I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Then that's all you had to say.
What crap?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Can we go now?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
He was, like, a total babe
As in...
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
What if she never starts dating?
Never
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Away.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Fine, thirty.
Do what?
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
Who cares?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Pleasant?
Try lookin' at it from this angle
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
I dazzled him with my wit
So what's your excuse?
The duck?
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No.
You tell me.
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
Because I like to torture you.
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Kat a fan, too?
We'll all go crazy...
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
I find that hard to believe.
Thank God...
You don't usually ask.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
Call them.
All of them created by people like me.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
My horse doesn't work.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You will regret this.
And what do you think Mendez?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Oh, sure.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
I'm sorry.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah, right.
Vodka tonic.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Nah, why should you?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I kill someone famous.
Alright.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Tonight.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
See you later.  Good luck.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Two weeks.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Be quiet.  Watch.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
A job?
You want the tape?  There it is!
In love?  With who?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
How long they been livin' here?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
What is it, Hal?
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Any clue as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
I want to pick up my car.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
No way to start a partnership.
Luther was part of the gang?
I may call you worse than that.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Must be billy's girl.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Jesus.
Shit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Doesn't look like it.
You're hopeless.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
What do you want?
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Naw, right here's okay.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Give it back.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Leeloo's in trouble?
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Don't exist bud.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Hi Ma...
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Does it get any better or what!
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
You're the only one left alive...
I'm not going.
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
What is it?
What is... Make Love?
Which one?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
OK, you can turn around!
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Protect life... Until death.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
How much time is left?
Recommendations.
Amen..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Don't...
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What are you talking about?
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
I want to watch you work.
Machine.
Where are the women?
Sure.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Eddie.
Stop talking.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
That's right.
You'll get it when we get there.
Three, four years.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
You're learning.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Who is he, his name?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
He succeeded.
I'm afraid I don't...
No.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
I'm not positive this means anything.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Those are her belongings.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
I don't want to.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
So?
Nice neighborhood.
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
It's okay, Dan
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Alice...
I've got to go.
Had kind of a long night.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
That's the only reason you're alive...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
That's their problem.
Meaning?
No shit.
All of us.  Right?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
'Us?'
Listen!  Hear that?
What???
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Thank you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
I'll be another!
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Same old shit.
Chub says you're fired.
How soon?
Yes.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Mmm.
Really.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
In the chest.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
What?
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I want to go home.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Want to buy?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
Hi honey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
But not now.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Then... I guess you have to.
When did she die?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Something about my father?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Crawl!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
What happened?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Want to know what I think happened?
Which is?
I don't know. You tell me.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
Jim... for godsake!
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Got it.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Got it.
Stay cool.
This doesn't make sense.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Nine.
why did they do that?
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Scared. We're scared.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
That's my job.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Elaine, we have to go back.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
I'm so excited, Simon.
That's my girl.
That's not possible.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Can I hold him?
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
He had fish, too.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Every day.
Yes, Captain?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Yes...
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
When will Strader return?
My wife?  She worries about me.
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
To the... to the beach?
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
What's that?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Departmental policy.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Stand back.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Where?
You might be disappointed.
You were sublime.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Now?
Yes!
Why?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Why? People fart backwards.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Yes!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Yes, my love?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Oh, Stanzi.
It's killing me.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Alone.
What?
Why you?
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah-ha!
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Enchanted, Madame.
Ah! By all means.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
I have no idea.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
That's not what I hear.
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
I will, sir.
In there, sir.
What medicine?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Madame.
Really?
How could I not?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Do you have a daughter?
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
A Mass for the dead.
How much?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Yes.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
What is what?
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
I poisoned his life.
He's setting that play to music?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Of course.
Bene.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Yes, Doctor.
Is David acting strangely?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Now what do you want to talk about?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Charming.
Anything.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Pull over.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
I swear, I don't know this girl.
No.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Good.
Right.
She's a jerk.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
No, but he was on the moors.
Come on, where?
Where are we going?
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
Shut up, you zombie!
Will you be quiet?!
What?!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Jack, are you really dead?
Why don't we ask him?
Then you have some hot tea?
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Why not?
Yes - sure—
Where's Matt?
It was more than that last week.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
know, but—
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Good for you. Come on.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
All right. Send him in.
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
Why pick on him ?
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Yes, sir.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Hardly.
Well, he was making love to her.
They must have turned him down.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Was it twelve o'clock?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
What?
Tomorrow.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
And I'm the better outlaw.
I'm thinking...
They're just insurance in case we run.
The District Marshall
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
You're right, sir.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Hell of a war.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Maybe, maybe...
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Yeah, Jimmy?
So what was he?
Yeah Jimmy?
Everything but the boring parts.
Say your prayers?
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
If you don't see it, it's not real...
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
And the same age Web was. No.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
You been with a girl ever?
I swear.
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
What, sir?
So you can't tell me anything?
No.
Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Yes, darling?
I don't want to talk about it.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
No.
The message you left.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
See you then.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Can you bring Mr...
Oh no. I have no plans.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
A model? An actor?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Who?
Coffee?
Understandable.  Lime?
Shoot.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
You sure?
What do you mean...Yale thing?
No, he just hung out there.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Nothing.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Suit yourself, I guess.
Yes.
I'm not...
Al.
"Make" him?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
It was a hate crime.
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Nothing.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's gonna get cold.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
I don't think he knows how.
Yes sir.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
We could move 'em up here.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
'Sorry about the late notice...
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Just thought his work should go on.
You're compulsive.
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
But you said the other --
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
You may.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
How do you know?
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Who?
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Indeed.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Fair enough.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Behave!
Where did you learn to shoot?
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Dr. Evil?
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
We don't judge here.
Really?
Seriously?
Sir August...?  What now?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Looks like rain, Steed...
Too many cooks --
Ring?
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Mother?
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Or half cocked.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Was I?
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
It's called Black Leather.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Have a look at this.
Where are you going?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
But --
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
I see.
I know all this.
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
... and now?
Global warming?
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Anyone particular in mind?
In your operation.
...Really?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Bond... James Bond.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
No.
Not interested.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
But how can I do that?
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
I'm going now, Cole.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Let's get naked.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Let's have a toast.
You're a pimp?
That's it.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
It's Bullwinkle.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
C'mon. I insist.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
What's this?
Very.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Who's your friend?
I'll stop him... You stall him.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
It works.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Shut up!
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
I wanted to be a good one.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
The outlets.
Trychticholorate.
-- Another backdraft.
No it couldn't.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
But the right guess on this is arson.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
-- You remember.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Don't you have any leads at all?
No Marty, I don't.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Those fucking Mob assholes.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
How 'bout...
1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
YEAH!
Well you did.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
What do you do?
Why are you smiling so?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
You're in this up till ya neck.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
No offense.
How much?
To what?
Why?
I'm sorry I'm late.
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
We think so.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Manray!
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Thanks.
I don't want to hear it.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
He, I'm Mona.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
No.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
It looks delicious.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
I just turned twenty.
What's a Negro.
Thank you.  And always smile.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
I thought you got rid of...
...I heard different, thought that was...
...like macaroni and cheese...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Y'know what?
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
The coward!
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Not even that.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Dark Valdez.
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
What do we do?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
We found him like this --
We found him like this...
I'm not telling you what happened.
That'd be my reaction too --
Jesus!
And the bodies?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Sir, yes, sir!
You hated West more than any of us.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Then who did?
But you didn't.
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You're off to a late start.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
I lied. Wait for it...
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
What?
You wanted to get the truth.
Think it'll work?
Get in.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Wrong answer --
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Yeah.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Fine, you do it.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You're right.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
You know where the chemicals are?
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
Okay. Okay.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I wasn't expecting you.
Mmm, what?
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes. But that's a different...
Do you know who that is?
No I don't.
There's over eighty thousand here.
Thank you.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
No, no...
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Tell me.
No. It's not that.
John.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
Right. Okay. Good.
They go.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Why?
What?
I'm trying to quit.
It's what you came back for.
Just wanted to see.
Yeah, I know.
I need to uh...
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Come on, gal...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
I tried.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Now, hold up.
What'chu sayin'?
One thing at a time, Laz.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
That's right.
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Are you wasted?
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Get rid of it.
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Who do you think the Jap is?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
I didn't know.
I said let's go, Charlie.
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
I stole them.
Gaiijin.
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
Let's go.  Him first.
No.
I can't...
Luck.
I don't give tours.
You have a helluva way of answering.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Who am I supposed to be?
No one's keeping him here.
What if I chant?
Might be different in New York.
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
Right.
Do you know what this is?
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
You certainly have a nice place here.
Then go get him.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
You're just all so... so different.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
No.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
What was he after?
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Yeah.
Go.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Why, yes, of course.
How do I stop one?
No thanks.
I don't know.
Money?
Can I come in?
Do you recognize any of them?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What shows?
Are you for real?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
What do you want me to do?
Sit.
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Me and my dad.
Oh.
How are you doing?
Because it's not.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Yes.
What one?
Good.
My office.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Are you French?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Yes.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Right.
I can't, it's yours.
Doing what?
What's the pay?
Night!
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Everybody's divorced.
The engine is still running.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Good for you.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Sure.
That's boring!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Goodnight!
Is that what you call it?
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
Gee-ma-nee!
What?
Yes, sir.
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
No kidding!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Yes, father?! Yes?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Uh, I think they have.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
When did we get it from them?
Okay.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
The hotel.
My father is a genius.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Good!
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Well, we're here to help!
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Yeah.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Yes.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Yes, dear!
To you maybe.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Right here!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Yes...
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
I don't believe it!
Excuse me.
I want him to at least see the sky!
Some time.
What can I offer you, Eve?
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What?!!
You're goddamn right I am!
To get some frozen poultry.
Stand by. One.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Shit. You better tell me something.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want?
I'll go then.
OK.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
You what?
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. Are you?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
No.  Hi baby.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
My bourbon.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Okay Frank.
Good, let's drink up.
Mom.
Yeah?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Well.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Are you feeling okay?
Good deal Dad.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Yeah, but.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
What did you see?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That's what I thought.
Okay, Sandy.
I'm really sorry.
Shoot.
Yeah.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Up where?
Aye.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Well, I didn't but...
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Know any other languages?
For what?
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Three.
Rocco!
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
You sure you killed them?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I believe these young men are right.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Yes.
The... The funny man.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
Dignan, it's --
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
You're right. You're right.
I don't want to use it.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
OK. Go ahead.
Bob?
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
This morning.
Where was I?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
I don't think we can do that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Ah. Couple days ago.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Eleven fifteen.
Did that hurt?
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
We all set?
Where's Kumar?
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Yeah.
The grandfather clock?
Oh, I'd say about --
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Hold it.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
Me?
No, that door over there.
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
OK, Dad.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
What do you mean?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Wait a second.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
That never would of --
Yes. I did.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
He electrocuted someone?
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Not bad.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
He's stuck between two floors.
What's that?
Now!
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Fight. You know.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Did he say anything to you?
I'm sorry, Ward.
I speak English.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Conklin.
I don't know.
I don't know who that is.
I'm sorry.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
We can't wait to be sure.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
Switch! You drive!
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
There's no choice.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
Abbott?
Are you disappointed?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
Is there. Is all there.
Still...
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
He has already agreed to come.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
I don't want to be a martyr.
That's just a dream, William!
I will not.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
I... accept your proposal!
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Tonight then.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
That is not possible.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Fix?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Fuck off, frat boy.
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
So how's Tommy?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
What do you want to know, Evan?
So it didn't feel... weird?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Like how?
I walk differently?
He's a fucking maniac!
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Different? How?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Which is?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
And...?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Me neither.
And you are...?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
What's wrong with you?!
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Yes, I'll bet.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
He always has.
Oh, yes, please.
What is your name?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
Monsieur Rick!
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Practically no one.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
And the other alternative?
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
We said "no questions."
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
And Laszlo?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
No.
Goodnight.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Not at all.
Go ahead.
Yes, rather.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
No. It's all arranged.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
I slept very well.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Good evening, Captain.
Mademoiselle.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Find one.
The clipper to America.
What, again?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
I have my orders.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Our expenses?
Take your hands off me!
Put it down!
Hello Ugarte.
No.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Yeah?
Do too little you'll die.
Going to die anyway.
No.
No.
Moon's too bright.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
They're on autopilot.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
You are.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
As much as anybody.
You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
You?  Personally?
Must be a story there.
So do I.
You smell like formaldehyde.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to.
No.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
Is that Jango?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
You're fucking dead!
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Dr. Homer Wells.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I know.
I doubt it. She's just an...
Good night, Daddy.
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Sure... I'll see you around.
People watched the movies in their cars?
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
I never said they were boring.
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
What about the trees?
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
I haven't read that.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
We heard that one already, Homer.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
So what?
Almost.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Not yet. What do you know about it?
We see you next harvest.
It look nicer then home!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
I told him that you all is sick.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Everything looks in order.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Know who I am, Jake?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
You're a superstitious fucker.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
After you cut her loose.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
So what? We hide, right?
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
We pay better.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
You can't cheat an honest man.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Stake you?
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Great. Thank you.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
What do I have to do?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
No, I want my cut!
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
We're getting a little old for running.
Escorts!
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
With identification.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Pretty much.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
The King.
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
Who was he?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Found a job?
Well, thank you anyway.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I don't gamble.
That's fine.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Then you're not a pro.
I know that. But you can now.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
But if it does.
What ten thousand pounds?
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
Yes.
I've still got mine.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Ross.
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
I'm Lucy.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
I'll tell you later.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I put them on together.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
I was at Beadles.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
Five.
I said good call.
What for?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
That hair will have to go.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
He's a good customer.
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Doolittle, are you there?
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Armed.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
I'll check it.
Any of 'em any good?
Fred.
Out where?
-- automatic channels open --
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
No kidding?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
Yeah.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Could you give us a moment.
No time.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I got overhead...
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Yeah, me too.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
They took my daughter.
I don't want to move away.
No...
Thank God.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
I'm not a half bad cook.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
We are not fine.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
I already don't like the sound of this.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Somebody's got to.
I'm sorry.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
I need to talk to her.
Oh?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You're also a fool.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
You're crazy.
She's got my word.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
You're the best, Maxie.
Right, the big one-oh.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
Does this person have a name?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Shut-up...
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
He's sick.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Thanks.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Bye.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
YO, DOOFUS!
Sunday, but...
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Nah. Couldn't be.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Hawk?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
But, mom!
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
What?!
No.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
GOOD MORNING!
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
I'm not following you.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You'll know soon enough.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Until it withers away.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
And what?
What?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
What do you mean?
Then when? I have to talk to you.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
But you're OK?
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
What about your family, Donnie?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Have you ever made love, Donald?
But you were punished.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
What did you want for Christmas that year?
You've done it again?
Why?
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Gerald.
What I think is going on with your son.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
You can suck a fuck.
How did you know --
It is a big deal.
How did this happen?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Go back to China, bitch!
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Yeah, you betcha...
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Airport Ho-Jo!
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Huh?
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Bye.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
I got a hairdo.
Okay. Take her purse.
Dakota.
All right, then.
The bitch.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
All right, let's go.
We need more bars!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
"My dear President"...
"My dear"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My dear President"...
Send for my car...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Well - what is he now?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
I don't want him.
Did you shoot the rapids?
What other job you got?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
I don't wanna work at all.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
I can't do it...
Sure.
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
Give me that again!
Once more! 
Yes.
That's it...
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
Your Excellency!
You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
Take a seat -- you're next. 
No, I think a whiskey.
Do you?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He fell.  He falls.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I could easily arrange...
Three quarters of an hour.
What a mess.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Tell me about it, please!
No, but I certainly shall.
Yes.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
Where did you get this box?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
The hospital?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Good morning.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
Halfdan the Black.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Shut up.
You don't love ME.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Why?
Well... no...
Very deep... usually...
He wants to KILL us.
What's it all about?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
ROW!
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Like fish.
Nobody gets killed.
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
DEATH!
You will wait?
Vanish into thin air?
Same thing, isn't it?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
I'm not worth risking your life for.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Hang on...
You can't let Erik do THAT.
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mum.
And keep your sword greased.
No one.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
And I just liked you so much.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Oh. So...
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I'm sure you would.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Yeah.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Frost?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
No, I'm okay for now.
You pick it.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
I want to have a baby.
Yeah, Tangerine?
I did it. I guess that means something.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Not yet. Not married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Yeah, like that.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Jesus.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I just got in.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Go back to sleep.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Very cool. Trippy.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yeah.
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Well, what should we do?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Welcome, Howard.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
You made me have an abortion.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Clockworks?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
You don't?
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Hitchhiking?
You're the best?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
The containment, Second Containment...
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Can you shut it down?
Hurry.
Run!
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
What does?
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Justin. I won't let you die.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Thanks.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
You're lying...!
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Yes, sir.
What's causing the readings?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Justin's in the airlock.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Can you shut it down?
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
I'm trying, goddammit --
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
He's made a few changes.
Yeah, nine years straight.
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
We're working as hard as we can --
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
That's terrible news...
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Never better.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
You were?
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
There it is!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Manager!!
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Dad says!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
No.
Damone! You come here?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Naw. Any good?
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Believe it.
Well I never did it.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Not since November.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
No.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
He's not coming.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Oh... yes.
Excellent.
Not at all.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
What about the notes?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Awake? What do you mean?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Crying? Why was she crying?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Dobermans don't talk.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Las Vegas.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
You whore!
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Are you ready?
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Plans?
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
I fear nothing.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
Part of what?
Spare me.
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Upstairs.
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Well, justice is funny.
What's it for?
Fuck you too.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Okay then.
Good.
Open?
Max?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
NO, but I will lock you in.
You keep that key handy.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
BONSAI!
Amazing you made it this far.
Am I too heavy for you?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Go!!!
I'm fine, I really am.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Excuse me, sir?
You know what I mean.
...acts. I'll relay your message.
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
He's not here.
A rich actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
What does Clifford say?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
You want his name?
All square, Doc.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
You wrote it, didn't you?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
He's a socialist, then?
I know.
And you think it's worth all this?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
See you next weekend?
Fifteen.
I wouldn't miss it.
Why... yes.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Harry.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
What happened to him?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
You're telling me.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Think I'll have a glass.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
And?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
Who said I was a lady?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
What's that?
Oh Harry...
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
How did I look?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Yes.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
I don't care.
Why are these all opened?
What's wrong?
I have!
But what -- 
Thanks are hardly necessary.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
'Incurable.'
What kindness?
Better that way... for me.
Kill you? Hardly that.
This was not taken from a grave.
She's not for you.
Quite right!
And you look so lovely.
Fine.
I wish to be your wife.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I give you my soul...
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Somebody has to!
I resent God's monopoly.
Yes? And?
You've been going round-the-clock?
Let it go.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Why?
Are you a physician?
Who are you?
You're right. It makes no sense.
Almost five.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
I meant everything.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I'll spot you five points.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Whatever you make yourself.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I guess...
I call it my shower dream.
Mmmmmmmph.
Okay, Fireman.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
For two lonely nights.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
I have no idea.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Sorry, I need everybody.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Died instantly?
Yes.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
He backed down.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
To yours.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Kate, Scott?
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
Not good enough, swear to God.
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
Where are you taking us?
What did I say?
Yeah, we got a bible.
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Not even for lunch?
What?
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
That's what I hear.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Who's "we"?
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Motherachrist...
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Should probably ask him that.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
You'll think about my offer?
No, ma'am.
... two... one... MARK!
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
This has nothing to do with you.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
I saw an article...
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
No shortage of suspects.
What about him.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Just askin'
"Dad."
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
That's not right.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
MOVE!
Thought you two were file-closed.
Women.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Big bites.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
But we can get to the west side faster.
No.
It's good to see you, Nick.
Yeah, well...
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
How do you know?
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Your old sweetheart?
And you're beautiful...
We know.
That's right.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
What are you suggesting?
We've met before.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Good idea.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
"The show must go on."
Nothing.
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Shut up.
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
The enemy is matching velocity.
You... know us?
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
Not a clue. You?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
... Maintenance facility...
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
Push It. Hold it down.
Oh god...
Pedal to the metal...
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Get oacK on their tail.
Because they're coming right at us.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
What?  What are you talking about?
That you would have known you can trust me.
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Gag on your own invention, then.
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
I understand, George.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I rode here, on my horse.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
General Lee, sir!
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
I think I heard that.
We're leaving them?
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Or, 'civilized'.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
I think I will disappoint you.
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
That land belongs to the strongest.
Yes!
Who says so?
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Calm down, Bear...
We'll get it later.
Yayo. Where is he?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
That's right, me.
She's... young.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
Three.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
That's the magic number.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
That's right.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
What've you got?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
So you don't work for the casino?
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
Who's the star?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
I found him.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
We talk different?
You mean like we don't give a shit.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
One we're producing.
Martin, look at me.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
I believe it.
Okay. I'm listening.
I'm up twelve grand today.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
You thought I was faking?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
I don't hear anything.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I'm going.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
That's where you got the idea?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Chili and me.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
That's what it says.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.
Roger?
Bring it on, dude.
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Seen a lota movies.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
If they knew what they were carrying.
What?!
Don't lie to me!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Too big. More like a freighter.
You're a pal.
Yeah. Thanks.
Nope.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
But where's the damage?
Doesn't matter.
I don't know, are we?
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
I don't know.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Alright. I'll be right up.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
Moving to Sweden.
Say what?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Are you going to yell at me?
About what?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
It's not optional!
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
No.
I figured something like that...
I guess.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
What a little hosebag.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Fuck you, bitch!
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
I know a party we could go to...
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
I don't believe you.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
So where's all your stuff?
Just because.
Who does?
Later, "Dude".
Well why do I care about that?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Well are --
OH MY GOD!
Jesus, Seymour.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Yeah, but still...
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
And you like them?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
...What do you mean?
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I'm just being realistic.
I hate sports.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
No problem.
I am.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Maybe she's with Josh?
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Do you have a check for me?
Let me see the sick.
You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
-careful, Abdullah-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Starling?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
You never had it.
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
I assure you we came close many times-
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
John, it will not be easy.
What did I do?
Only in life... 
I'll have to.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
That's exactly what you said last week.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Let me jingle you right now.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
What are you doing up here?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Too bad for the Moldavians.

My pleasure.
I know.
Then why have you come?
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Did I forget something?
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Like what?
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
And we're the ...
Something good --
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who, Ray?
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Eight o'clock?
Hi, Louis.
All right, what happened to me?
So what do you think it was?
It's in the stars.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
Is that a game?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
In a storage facility.
Why do you want to see it?
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Then my theory was correct.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
You talked to Gozer?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Where are you, Pete?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
And the seas would boil ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
Caesar?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
I'll nose around...
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Why you?
Sneaking around with your brother?
Servis made it through again?
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
I can't let you do that.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Greeks?
Athenians...
They're studying with Cynics.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Before they leave, get gold.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
I don't know.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine --
No.
No.
I'm glad.
I do.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
That woman --
That woman. The older woman.
Get out of here.
I've never been to it.
Oh.
Is it because I'm here?
I think it is.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
Don't you have it on?
No.
But Elaine --
I don't know.
I don't know.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't see how we can.
Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
What are you then?
Ahhh.
What?
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
Could you bring it up?
Benjamin?
Give me an hour.
What?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
A single room or a double room?
What? No. Nothing.
Where is it?
What?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
In general.
What?
When is he coming back?
No.
Yes.
Look -- I think I should be going --
No.
What's wrong?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
But they would! Don't you see?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Do you understand what I said?
I've got to go.
Of course.
Waiter!
Have you gotten us a room yet?
That's fine.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
You're welcome.
You what?
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Oh my God.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Don't you?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
I don't.
Yes I do.
I don't remember.
What?
What?
Right.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Think real hard, Benjamin.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
At college.
Yes.
How do you think.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Then let's hear them.
You're not.
Are you?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
May I stay then?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Go home now.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
No wait. Wait.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Goodnight.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
I've got to go.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Thank you.
Oh yes.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
That's quite a statement.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Yes?
Yes?
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
That what he says. Right?
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Have you got that skeleton key?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Free --
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Chasing what?
Money.
I'll do anything for you.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
Yes -- oh!
Nothing -- only to be here.
Certainly.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
You are beautiful!
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
For Vienna?
I can't.
Not at all, sir. 
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Then you know him?
A little strange, Baron.
All right then.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Yes -- but the audience.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Telegrams?
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Yes -- that --
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Preysing?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Moreover --
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You're a very unusual stenographer --
What brown hands you have.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
With the same friend?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
No -- now.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
All right.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Next week.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh!
Take them back, Suzette.
What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, I know them --
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
My son --
Your what?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
What's that, Lilly?
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Henry, no!
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Hello.
Well, uh... No.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Fair enough.
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I've really got to --
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I know you do, so that's why --
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Mm?
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I'll see you when you get home.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Take a hike, you mean?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
I went out to Delmar.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
No! Because I --
) What?
Thank you.
That's natural.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
No, its -- Why did she--?
No blood on the knife.
Only the real stiffs.
Charming.
Carter.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Please, get on the bus...
Where'd you get it?
I can't afford to get caught.
I came to see you.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
You're unbelievable.
You're so easy...
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Guess so ...
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
I've come to help your family.
Kara, no!
Wait a minute ...
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Retiring.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
A bitch.
Oh, shit.
At least we found the diamonds.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
Months?
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I dunno.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
You've come to the right man.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
You're my buddy.
As a matter of fact--
Are you--
Dr. Woodly.
Is anybody besides you here now?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Your old beau?
We all are.
I did?
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
It couldn't!
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
Yes.
No you're not!
Why not?
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
He knows you shattered his violin.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
You're begging him to kill you?
Honor, I suppose.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
You hope this, too?
Don't!
Stop!
I mean it!
Out!
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
None.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
There's a certain amount of information there.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I'm an honorable clown?
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
Don Quixote.
You're too modest.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Get up.
It's trash now, like mine.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
What happened?
I dunno.
I don't care what she wears.
Thank you, kind sir.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Don't worry about it.
He'd assume we had.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm glad.
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
I see.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
I believe in miracles now.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Phooey.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
I just want to ask some questions.
What?
What do you mean?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
How many weeks?
We offer...
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
What's that shade of blue called?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Nah.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
Is Kristen safe?
Fuck.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
But what?
What makes you so sure?
...What do you have to offer?
No.
They're legal now.
Do the police want to arrest me?
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Just leave me alone.
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
Not exactly...
I thought you were a businessman.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Come again.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Where are the papers?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
What?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Oh, look! The birds.
Well then.
Sort of.
All right.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
It's so blue.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Oh, you weren't scared.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
You should have been a poet.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
A rough estimate.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
No.
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Yes.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
ZAT!
Souvenirs?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Time to play.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
What's the matter with her?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Are you crazy?
WHY?
I've come for my father!
Nonsense, I...
The Cenobites.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
That makes him more than a hundred --
He's just going through a phase --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
You're doing fine.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
What are you trying to say?
Each of us gets a belt.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Oh-n-no -- I --
Myers?
No. Myers is taking me.
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
He's just pushy.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
Hi.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
You can keep them.
Kirsty?
No.
One last time. Give me the box.
Tell me who you are.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Tell me, damn you.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
It's just been empty a while.
The best part of ten years.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
I hear you.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
You're done worse.
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Sure.
Please...
It's better you see for yourself --
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No personal details?
Maybe I will.
I won't be a moment.
Do you want me to come over?
I will. See you.
I love you too.
It's like she's waiting for something.
He's gone.
I don't believe it.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Will you GO, damn you?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
But now I kind of like it.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Fuck off, Barry.
Yes way.  It's really...
So?  You even said they're good.
Sonic Death Monkey.
NO--!
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Bullshit.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
What are you talking about?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Is there a difference?
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
I want a tape.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Who's that?
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
-- Alright, alright but --
You really believe that?
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
I don't know.
We'll talk some other time.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I guess.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I'm not -- hold on...
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
You still together?  Going all right?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Well, think about it.
I can't talk right now.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
How?  How were we the same people?
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
It's a crematorium.
Is Ray going?
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yes.  You?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Fuck off.
What's the name of your label?
It's in good condition.
Grave robbers?
Probably.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Dupont Circle.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
You are.  Now.
You make it all sound so simple.
Yes.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
A little dusty.
I hope I never get that old.
Yes.
All of it finished.
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
Yes.
All fashionably without heads.
You're an asshole, Moran.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
-Et lux perpetua-
You're not from these parts.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
How can you know this?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
You are still so very young.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Me father has taken back my hand.
What would you like?
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Where did you learn that?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
MACLEOD!
Leave her alone.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
What are you getting at?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
For the moment.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
Oh yes, more than enough.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
What?
Sort of a Jack London style?
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Where'd she go?
Thank you.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Oh.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
How?
You haven't seen anything yet.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Sure you can. Come on.
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Keep away --
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Better.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
I'd like to think.
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
All the words you've got.
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Don't tell me you were worried!
In a way.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
It'll be Heaven!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I always have both.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
It's a deal. Let me up.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
They're always after me for interviews.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Call you back.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Not this gun!
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
I was just going to!
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Very well, Grandpa.
Who pays for them?
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
They'd gone.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
No, I won't.
And now we're glad you did.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Couple more miles up this road.
Come on.
I was just wondering.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Great story Goober, how much?
Hey, wait take this.
She's pretty cute.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
OK, Boss.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Lock the fucking doors.
Fine! I'll go straight!
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
I gotta open the gate.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
How's about you give me those same directions.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
How's he get around out here?
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
I don't want to see that.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I still don't.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That's the understatement of the year.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
You said it, not me.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
What!
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Please, just a minute.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Who's your Daddy!
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Hulk was dumb as shit.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Hmmmph.
What for?
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
Ouch. Yeah?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Really?
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Be still my crotch.
Rose, please go away.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
Where?
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
How's it going?
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Yes, and...
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Of course.
Absolutely.
What?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Lila...
Oook. Oook.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Got it.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
It's open...  What'll you have?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
That's right, Miss Packard.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Oh, about five hundred.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
It's possible.
Sit down.
Deal.
Only when I work.
Pool.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
A thousand.
Whaddya been so far?
You think I can lose?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Sign up.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Fast and loose, man.
I feel tight -- but good.
Eddie...
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
What for? To play Fats again?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Shoot.
Yes.
What?
Can I sit down?
No, not always.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I could always get us a bottle.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Mm hmm.
What did all this stuff cost you?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Give it back to me.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Is that what makes a winner?
I love you.
Yes, I'm glad.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Oh, grow up.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
That's right.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
Twelve. Cross side.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
That is not now, human!
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
Do you want to go on?
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
I only protect myself -- !
You know what I mean.
Shhh... don't talk.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Yes.
I surrender --
You got that right.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I'll take you to school.
Yes -- but ...
May I ask why?
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
No, but it was here.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
What?
You have to leave the White House.
He's a good man.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Haven't you been watching?
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
Just getting a feel for her.
I can't shake her free.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Better than we thought.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
Dick-weed!
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
It's all fuzzy.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
That'd be cool!
And before here?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
You've got it!
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Yes. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
That was our assessment as well.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
Are you sure?
Mine, too.
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
Don't know. Think of something.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
But what are you doing here?
Good point.
If only I could have been with you.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Yeah?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
She talks in her sleep.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
The floor's on fire! See?!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
You think so?
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Yes, I understand.
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
First of all -- don't panic!
Can you move your arm?
PET IT??!!
What does the writing say?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
I've never been so hungry in my life...
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
I am -- it looks horrible!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
Willie, come on!
Al ???!!!
Don't do that.
Al.
Yeah?
Shut up!
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I just went there for a job.
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Yeah.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
I did. I brought you back here.
Go out, take your first left.
Just scratched my arm, why?
I don't have any.
Why not?
I'll get in trouble.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The sand.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Are you screwing with any nerves?
.
Rene...
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
You got any books in there?
I don't know!
Shit! You're in love.
No. What will you do.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Come on.
I was afraid of that.
While he makes the run.
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
What exactly?
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
You've changed your mind.
That's nice.
It'll remind me of you.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
What a nerve!
Then how did you know?
Sir?
It is to me too.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
Oh.
How do I look?
I feel fine.
Sir?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
I didn't say anything.
Without what?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Why?
Who do you work for?
Why'd you run off?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why didn't you tell me?
No.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
And Dieter.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
How?
Where would you go to sell a chip?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
They asked about you.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Can't you do something?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
I'll come back for you.
Now what?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Thanks.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Poor bastard.
So we better get started.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
Sure. Where?
I'll be there.
What? Forget it.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
Oh, I love that stuff.
Lunch?
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Hey, Lowell.
How grave?
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Catch you later.
Call me back in ten.
Okay.  Lowell?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Yes.
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
No shit.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
What does this have to do with my testimony?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
It acts as a drug on the body?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
They hate each other --
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
I had no idea until after, but --
What part?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Uh... poetry recitation.
No frown lines.  New watch?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
So, that's good, right?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
No.
I said yes.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Did you see the tape?
I told you. I was hungry.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
No, that's not all.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
I don't believe you have "things."
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
That's blackmail.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Now. But first, he worked for you.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Dogs?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Sometimes I forget.
Wow.
Do you know him?
We do have a man for you.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Yes?
Excuse me?
She's here now.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Mm.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Video.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
What are they?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Muriel Rumsey.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
Yes, I know—but—
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
He's marvelous!
Are you going to see him?
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
Yes, of course.
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
Thanks.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
What happened?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
You must have me confused with—
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
What are you talking about?
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
What do you mean—starvation?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
I'm following you.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
was—but—
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
Eat a carrot.
What happened?
Darling!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Congratulations.
Who—me?  Want to see me?
Well, I am.
Do you know?
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Husband?
But can't you wait until morning—
Yes?
Yeah!
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Huh?
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Thanks, Joe.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Listen, man—I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
Yeah?
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Hey, you!
Wife?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
What?
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Did he pay?
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
There's a word - orders.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What did they...
It leads farther than that.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
What was so appealing about Houston?
I see.  And where did you drive?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I had the cause of death.
No.
What?
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
And he never hit you before?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Was he there often?
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Splendid, love to see them.
Germany.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
I won't forget.
You.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
What's she willing to give us?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Suspicion of what?
I'm not saying another word.
Beauty products.
Fine.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Okay.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
What did they want to know?
I didn't?
I am. Have a seat.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
How'd you feel about it?
Surprise.
How was it?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I called you last night.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Why?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Set him up.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I beg your pardon?
If I don't cooperate?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
We can look into that.
You know what we want.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
She told you that?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
You didn't count it?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I have no idea.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Hi, Melanie.
They asked.
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
If you want.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
Who?
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Where at?
What's a Metrix?
The roller disco one.
C'mon, don't lie.
I lived there for about nine months.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
He went to meet that stewardess.
You live with him.
Are you sweating?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Okay, Lou-is.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
She believed you?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Where you shot her.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Have fun.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You think you could do that?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
Git your ass in here.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
And you did that to protect my interest?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
My office.
She was afraid.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
I know where to turn.
Take me home.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
Daddy. Let go.
That's right. We did.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
What do you mean?
There was a bang.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
... I've seen them, too.
Shit!
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
How do you know?
A bit.
What did she have to say?
Who?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I'm walking, aren't I?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Jacob Singer.
Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Where are you?
Thanks.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Yeah, but for what?
Lemme see.
Where are we?
Why? What for?
Get your clothes off!
That's your decision.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Am I home?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Stay away from me, Jez.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Bullshit!
I promise.
Please.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Don't be funny.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Long time ago.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Like it was yesterday.
What's happening? Help me.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
They're awfully heavy.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Push 'em back.
I'm sorry.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
I work in a bakery.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
That black car?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
I don't know. Nothing.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Cool.
What are you doing back?!!
Not a chance.
You got that right.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Okay, good tip.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
I think I had some when I was eight.
I'm stuck!
Old woman?
Oh I like her a lot.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
You lost the charge?
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
So what else is new?
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Who are you apologizing to?
Get him out of there!
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
What have I done?! Idiots.
My boat's neat, dad!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
What?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
You got it.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Where...?
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
He's sitting in it.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
Let's all have a drink.
He ate a car?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
That means closing the beaches.
I wish it would rain...
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Think the tide's with us?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
You from around here?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Is anyone having this...?
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Anti-Shark cage.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
And I'll drink to yours.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I totally heard you did.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
No... I guess not.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
That suits you.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Room with a toilet, got it.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Thundercats are go!
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
I am a suicide risk.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
It's a loft.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Karma.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Is it hard to learn?
...Yeah, sure.
...Anything else?
That's not true!
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Early! Stop!!
Walter Livesy.
Vernon, Florida.
What do you need a Bible for?
Best kind.
...Too bad.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
A... I gotta go.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
A book on the warehouse murders?
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Nervous?
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
She wasn't feeling so good.
...Brian hurt his foot.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...That'd be my guess.
17.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Right.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Yeah.
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Darcy?
Yeah.
Right.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Yeah.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
You sure?
Yeah. I can understand that.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Do you care about me?
15.
No.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Are you in trouble with the law?
Thanks.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Passion...
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Yeah?
Do you know where he went?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
It's like...
Yeah.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah I get bored.
I hate 'em.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
No. I was just kidding.
Four-thirty in the morning?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
What?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Maybe you should.
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No, I need the original note.
Homesearchers.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
What do you mean, stand out?
What was suspicious about him?
But a hundred men could move him.
What?
You'll find her.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
Then call them!
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Let me speak to my daughter.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
What scars?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Nice meeting you.
Nothing.
How long has she been dead?
You mean, no prints but hers?
What about the way he arranged the body?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
What does that mean?
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
Maybe I already have.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Whatever's on your mind.
Uh huh.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
She could be dead now.
You sound like my mother.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
You're not?
I know it was bad.
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
And you?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
It's not that easy.
But I do.
Why?
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm not nervous.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Well, you're beautiful.
I knew you would come.
I won't leave you here.
I have no extraordinary powers.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You have not slept in two days.
He has come for Lyssa.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
I chose the wrong passage.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
You're coming with us.
Yes.
Let me comfort you.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
We must try to get horses.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
A small house.
No.
I have a cinnamon bar.
Look at its insides.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
He is the King.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
Where is he? My son.
It is no trickery.
You will come with me.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
...Not at all.
Do you need money?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Well, I don't need them...
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...Later.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
...Composer.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
For a walk.  I don't know.
I don't accept that.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Thank you.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
Okay.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
What it is -- is the truth.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You don't think I love you?
Anything?
Show me.
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
I've changed my mind.
Yes.
You can change.
It'll make it.
Pacifica, California.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
This guy's not a murderer.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
She knew you loved her.
What?  Who are you?
Evening News?
This isn't right.
Are you working?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Sera...
Sera you are crazy.
Don't be silly?
No?
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
When?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
OK.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
That's right.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I can't tell you.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Thank you.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
Was she carrying a weapon?
Spill.
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
No!
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Uh -- family.
Delta. Gamma.
Really?
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Picking out my wedding dress!
No way --
Margot!
Did she do that to you, too?
So?
What?!
Are you asking me on a date?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Absolutely!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
That's not entirely --
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Fire moat... why do that?
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Oh, yes...
Or looked so beautiful...
I didn't know... I --
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
And if I cannot?
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Don't you know?
Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
The wound is mortal.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
I was with the Princess.
That's it then... the ring!
Sorry.
Sport, indeed.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I'll go search for it.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Jack!
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
And I... love you...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
And I love you, my husband.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
I don't believe you.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
You'll visit again?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
I'm promised to another!
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Oh.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
You'd better call and cancel.
No.
Why?
Monday.
You're a good girl.
Hi.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Really?
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Not really.
I thought I was helping you.
He's got a standing invitation.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
What are you on?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
How's your wife?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
How old are you?
Thank you.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
You're here early today.
You have everything?
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
It bugs me.
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Did you got through my pants?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
I know.  Why?
Nothing.
I'm telling you now.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Oh.  Sorry.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Four days.  I left to think.
The garage.
When's school over?
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
I can't leave the house?
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
My stupid back.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I can hire workers to help me.
That was the truth.
You bit my finger.
Left you?
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
What?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Please don't leave me.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Okay.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
No, nigger.
And the baby?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
But you can't.
No, but...
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
Yes, sir.
He looks like he can take care of himself.
I don't think so.
Good old Monroe.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
A loan officer?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Oooh...
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
Reward?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Forget it.
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
I'm stuck!
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
Go where, Ray?
Back to New York for starters.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Gimme that damn thing.
So?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
What were they, bootleggers?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Jenny?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Me? Willie Long.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Absolutely not.
Noon...
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Everything's fine, pop.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
I was just playing with you.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Oh, would you grow up.
Yeah. You do it.
Yes, great movie...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
The South.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
..."The Devil?"...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
See something you like, my man?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Your turn.
From? From? From?
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
We're ready.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Why did you do that???!!!
No.
You felt sad. What's your name?
No.
And now?
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
You know something.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Uh-uh.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't listen.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
We'll be all right...  We will...
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
You know, Jessica.
...But I still have the choice...?
I don't know.
No.
What's that?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Alive?
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Can you make it back?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't think so.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Listen.
This is our bedroom.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
As best we can.
Ours, Ed.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Why are ya goin' so early?
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Alice?
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
No... I don't. Why?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
FUCKIN' "A".
The first night... Not the last two.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
A videotape.
Who's it from?
From the club. You didn't answer.
All right.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
But...
The heart, I guess.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Yeah.
Sheila...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Fossils, huh?
Uh-huh.
I see.
That's ridiculous.
Yes.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Horns? What kind of horns?
Think of it! In times like these.
All right.
Over by that hill.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Goodness, no!
So there are others?
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
The only one.
Yes, charming.
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
No porters here!!
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Hey!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
What is it, my son?
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Yes.
Hello? Colonel?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
Dead?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
That's what you said.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
I don't need any proof.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Yes.
was saying—
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
What if he refuses?
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
In for what?
What do you suggest?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
It's Fenner.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Go? Where?
Perhaps.
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
I'd go with number three.
It was a long time ago.-
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Where to?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
The Pentagon.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Right.  Oh, and here.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
What is it?
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
It's... coming.
Yeah, Kay?
What if I don't?
This guy.  Where was he?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Oh shit!
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Can you see?
Is it now?
Forget that guy --
Please --
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
We know each other?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
They were performance pieces.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
In the middle of the night?
I'm fine, Lamar.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Yeah?  So?
What?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Take your time.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Just a nickname.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
She's a precog?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
So?
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Come on!
All right, I'll try...
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I wanted to.
No.
Who said I would?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
I'm... not... a... killer.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Heal who?
You're talking about the precogs...
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
I believe in that system...
You said they're destroyed.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Sean --
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Lamar --
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
I forgot my glasses.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
He's not here now, is he?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
Yes.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
To what?  Trap him?
What does he want with a precog?
Not on me, sir.
What, sir?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
As far as...?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Come on. Let's go.
Bullshit.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
No coke tonight.  Right?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
So, when's the drop.
Where is this happening?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Where's Ricky?
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
What is it?
Where's the drop?
Well, this is the corner.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Then why do you try to get in?
We don't need guns.
I'll beat your ass --
How'd you unlock my phone?
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
Who's driving her?
I don't know.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Oh really. Why's that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Well, I don't want to walk.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
He woulda told us right?
You too?
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What's up?
We're not getting whacked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
The what?
The penguin house.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Wanna bet?
It was six in the fucking morning.
You're out of money?
Eighty five.
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
How much is what?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
It means you got a gun?
Why? What I say bad?
You want another drink?
Coke?
No, really, mate?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Thanks.
Yes. You're going to New York.
Keys.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Edinburgh.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Heard where?
Yes, sir.
What?
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
Nnnnnnn!
You never had it.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
Man, what do you want?
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Who are you?
I don't know what to say to Allah.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
I know.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
Because you're in trouble.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Please, go ahead.
Entirely.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Get out.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
How long has this been going on?
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
So you are going to talk me to death.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[I have a friend there.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[Who are you?]
[Where do I find him?]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[What do you mean?]
[Correct!]
[And I had my men ready.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
How long you staying, Crease?
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
So you were unhappy?
No.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Don't worry. You will.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Because...  I was already dead.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
What? Who?
He has to go.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
Two tourists who never went home.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
Yeah.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
No...
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
I'm stag.
I'll see you.
I never thoughta that.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
You gotta good heart.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Never this close.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Home.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
You make a mean martini, kid.
Duke Forrest.
I got some.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Any time. Whenever we want.
I have a tent to myself.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Don't stop now! Please...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
But what about Major Houlihan?
What?
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
They're coming.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
Hang in there.
It isn't always this rough?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
Yes, dammit, and...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
They can't do that to me!
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Yeah, I'm all right.
John Doe. The one in there. 
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Wait a minute . . .
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
What John Doe?
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Plus a bonus.
Oh.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Yeah, a little.
Baseball?
Did you find her?
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Who?
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Sure, you are.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Yeah, you bet!
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Uh-huh.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
That's right.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'll give you something.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Only at the very end.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
Recruited you from where?
Do you really?
I think so.
It'll come. Try again.
Why?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Which apartment?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Can I come in?
Scottie...
It's very nice.
...the hell are you talking about?
Your concern is heartwarming.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
I can't do that.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Yes.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
The woman you're stuck on.
Go!
Times Square.
Some things never change, do they?
No.
For what?
Realize?
Why not?
There?
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Uplink selected.
Speed?
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
Zordon...  he's gone.
Now tell me... what do you see?
... I just pray we're not too late.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
What's a Triac?
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
LET'S FLY!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
You want me to place a few calls?
Quack like a'duck!
So they've been destroyed?
Activating Power Scope!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Awwh, Charlie.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
But ya got a Boss.
The goddamned bastards.
Not another word.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
You scare me, Charlie.
Life knocked me back.
What do you mean?
Can't we get a couple whores over?
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I needed to see you again.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Like a party for all our friends.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Well - you'd need a body.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Hyp, I'll do anything.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Monkeybone...!?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Can't you give it to me later?
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
Dating anyone?
Mother!
Behind the books.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
I can make my own decisions.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
... Manly?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
It couldn't be.
No!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Paine.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
How about getting married?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
We're waiting, Hubert.
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Horace Mill--!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Himself!
Jeff for Senator.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Look! There it is!
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
No.
Here--where are you running off to?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Certainly would, Joseph.
Office of--Senator Smith?
The man downstairs said number--
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
Convene?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Some committee's got it.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Try sitting down.
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
No!
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Wow!
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Where do we go from here?
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Goodnight, Senator--
That's--that's splendid.
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Well--I can *manage*--
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Susan!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
That's right.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Jim, you don't have to--
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
Yes.
And you saw them happen?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Uh-huh.
That depends on what they see.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
All right.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
The guy's balmy.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
With pay!
With pay!
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
That's the rub.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
He's not home, I tell you!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
How do you do.
Why, no.
Buffer?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Only common sense.
What're you talking about?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Me?!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
South Dakota - north?
Is Mary home?
Thank you so much. Good night.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I did what!
Who?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
Really? You think so?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
What's that?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Not any more.
Right now?
What kind of doubts?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
But you did come to me.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
I'm sorry, your honor.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
Sure I can, Lionel.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Got a license?  But no car?
You're good.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
Uh-huh.
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Transference.
You're not the only one...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What happened today?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
No again?
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
I wondered what happened to her...
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
What about everything? How did this happen?
No... no training.
Wow.
And how does one do that?
And then killing your sister.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Altar boys?
None of the above, thank you.
What friend? You're my only friend.
What is he doing here?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
To be hanged.
Three hundred pounds!
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
Every damn day.
I know my treasure.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Something like that.
No you're not.
Very slowly.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got what?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Way to go, Evy.
Well neither do I, thank you.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
I know you did.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Fantasizing... about you.
One last tweak.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
So who killed him?
Let's do it.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Have you considered my offer?
Should I kill them?
You're nuts.
Are you with me... or against me?
So are you!
Frankenstein!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Curiosity.
Remember the cat.
Alone tonight?
Date?
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
It's home.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
He is in love. His anger is gone.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
I'll drive.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
So why don't you just tell her!
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Oh shut up.
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
No.
Yes.
Oh hi, Mom.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Right.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
And, what a delightful idea!
Things are quite serious, I should say.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Yes, sir, I am.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Oh...?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Junot?
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
When is she supposed to return?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
No.
Promise me.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Promises mean nothing.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Five minutes.
Goodbye.
Yes.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Of course, my dear.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
That is correct.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
We have a treaty with Austria.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Is he alone?
A message from Citizen Fouche.
You paid cash?
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Don't move me.
What happen?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Thanks for reminding me.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
What?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
That's the sister.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Nothing.
No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Smokin' what?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Sorry, dude.
Sorry, my ass.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
It's an important speech.
Huh?
I have a problem.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
And your husband works for somebody else.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Good.
Yes, I'm listening.
What's your point?
Forget about it.
I think you're right.
Nods.
I know you do, honey.
No. Kisses to you.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
What are you going to do now?
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Keep your eyes peeled.
Young love.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
She went.
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Twenty-five wives!
Fiddlesticks!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
What?
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
What!
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
The devil wins sometimes!
You better not sing that song.
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Mm-hm.
I'll tell you a secret.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Can I have my supper please?
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Answer me!
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Them kids!
Uh-oh...
Hi.
How you plan to do that?
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
You crazy? Hit him with what?
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
How you know that?
It wasn't that serious...
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
I won't.
Mother, for petesakes.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Jungle man fix Jane.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
What is it?
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
The Duchess...
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Eight forty-two, sir.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
But you can't...
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What did she say about me?
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Monsieur.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
No, thank you.
Well, we're back home.
Even the swallows are back.
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You might hold this for me.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
The telephone is ringing.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Will you smile?
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Radio! What is radio?
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
Yes, sweetheart. 
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Huh?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
How do you do?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Has done what?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
In that case I can only say good-by.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Why?
May I ask why?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Raw carrots and beets.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where do you eat?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
So ... let's go ...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
I'll bet he would.
Mitchell?
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
This is not a joke, John!
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
... go on.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Lincoln used it.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Sir?
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
I believe you're right, boss.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
You should ask Bobby.
I know ...
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
You're fucking me.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
No, Henry.  I don't.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
Free, if you're the president.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
... but it was all we had.
Syracuse.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
POWs.  And their families.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
It's over, Dick.
Yeah ... I'm out.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Are you okay?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
When?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
Don't be ridiculous!
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
To what?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
How you been, Ellis?
'Predate it.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
Most don't.
Not word one.
No.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
I don't know...
Gun out and up.
I'm ahead of you there.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
No sir.
You gonna drive out there?
Yes Sheriff.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I always am.
What do you think.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
What're you doin', baby?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Yes ma'am?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What makes you say that?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
I can't say.
What way would that be?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
Yes I do.
You married into it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Sir?
...Where you want me to put it?
What kind of tent?
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
That's got two double beds.
I do like you.
It's called a transponder.
I don't mean braze.
Pot metal?
The heroin. You don't have it.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Don't jack with me.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
So she did witness it?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
"Banners?"
They're fine... you miss it?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
I'm sorry.
I better go check on them.
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What's so special about it?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You're in serious danger!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I'd slap his face.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Like Rome?
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
The one you were telling me about?
God, that's awful!
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
What? Where was he?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
You still in love?
Rosa...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
No, that should be more than --
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Ahh... my wife's.
If we're for real?
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
Of what?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
My socks?
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
What the hell's the matter with you?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
I never said that I believed...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
It is, if you like idiots...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Would you say she was ambitious?
"A Reason to Love."
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Waitaminute -
Do not seek the treasure!
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Latch right on to that tit.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Powas p'suasion.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
No weddin'.
Not your...
Uh-huh.
That don't make no sense!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Million point two.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I never said any of that!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Why? Because you can do it alone?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
You what?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
What?
I got my foot on the floor.
Great.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Do you go to school?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
So?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Yeah. All week long.
Yeah.
A little.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Peace out.
That's right.
You know how this gotta end.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
They're gonna die in there!
Do me a favor and don't talk.
I don't get it.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
478-0150.
478...
Wait.
Chills?
Don't though. 
What am I, a five year old?
I saw something, I saw...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Fuck that, we've got company...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Yes sir, I did.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
You mean...
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Right on Brother Judge...
They were empty...
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Well, act like it. Come on.
Fuck maybe... be there.
Just the legit shit.
Nothing.
What?
Where is he?.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
You don't look alright.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
That would be nice.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
What unit?
My pleasure, sir.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
You're in no condition to ride.
Is that so?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Cheraw Falls.
You know what happened.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
You said bribery twice...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not held, just slowed down.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
When?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
That's enough, Ellen.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm sure you're not.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Yes, but--
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
This time I mean it.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
Shit! Look at this mess!
You don't understand--
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Then why aren't you eating?
It's a pirate medallion.
Commodore, you can't do that!
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Yes, father.
I know the code.
It would appear, so do you.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Yes, the rum is gone.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
We'll see about that.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Indeed.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
Only a little.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
How?  The key's run off.
We need to go!
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
This way!
Jack!
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
My apologies, Governor.
Where did he come from?
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
But --
Please.
Until he's done.
Speak.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
If you loved me like I loved you?
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
A man?
What are you going to do?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Same old Daniel.
Is that so?
I guess I should be flattered.
That's what I thought.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Mouse?  What mouse?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
What waste?
The waste.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
No, no, I just feel wired!
What?  What's wrong?
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
What did you want my hair for?
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
I remember I was trying to help...
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
The question is, are you?
And you have him?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Exactly.
Goodbye, Stew—
Certainly. Right over there.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
I know that.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I see.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
Huh?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Oh yeah?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's so.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
You're my what?
Quite so. Quite.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
There you are—!
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Nothing.
Must be my wife.
To Old Madrid.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
I have it here.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Holy jumping swordfish!
I don't eat waffles.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Yes sir.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
... Sex.
Yes.
What?
What?
I had to say goodbye.
She's crying.
Sure you are.
... Lover's Lane.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
With what?
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Very well ...
The basketball team?
You're not allowed to lie.
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
Owns the hardware store.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
They're happy like this.
Really? It seems so fattening.
The pages filled in?
What?
Right here.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. I baked them for you.
No I won't. I swear.
What the hell's going on!
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
EXCUSE ME?
I'm going to leave now.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
I'm so glad you're here.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Yes.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Just listen to me ...
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Really?
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
Yeah. TV busted?
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
Cool.
Cool.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
This is "Fly With Us?"
Ok. Thank you.
Hello.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Did I say that?
No.
You look nervous.
Are you gonna do it?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I....please don't do this.
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Are you watching a porno movie?
No.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
No. I'm sorry.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend --
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
It was cool last night.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Ok.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Sure.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
Alright?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Yeah?
Yeah, no, I see --
Yes.
Ok.
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Are you learning how to play it?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
...yeah...
Ok. Have a good trip.
Hi.
Yeah.
So what do I do then?
I just wanted to make sure.
It's so nice.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
For what?
What is this?
You can't do that.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Just have you for one second, please.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
I'll say whatever I want --
That's that.
Mhm.
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
Fine, thank you.
Why you wearin' a suit?
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
You're goin' on a trip?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Wait a minute --
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
What do you have in the house?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
You can't just stay in your house.
Don't puss out.
I won't.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
I thought Latisha said you would --
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Sorry.
So...did my brother call you?
No.
Ok.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
He's a writer, not a madman.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
"Turn you out?"
Why not?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
Don't be so sure.
And --?
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
Do I have your word?
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Good day, Marquis.
His rug.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
What on earth would that require?
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
NOW STRIP.
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
It's a formality; truly.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
His wife's influence.
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
And my own.
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
But it's just begun --
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Randolph!
Don't
Yes.
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
You will not walk out on me
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
How so?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Huh?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
What are movies about?
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Sorry to disappoint.
Don't do this
The title?
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
Mank!
Oh God.
Again.
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I don't want to sit
Ok, champ.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
None of your fuckin' business.
Whadda you care?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Yeah --
Go 'head.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Except fall down like a normal person.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
No, I just told you what happened.
Yeah. At night.
Three more, I figure.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
You asleep?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Never felt better.
Right, the gym.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
He has it. Thank you.
Name me a better photographer.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
I was jaywalking.
What time?
If possible -- both.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
Where'd they take Lisa?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
No.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
That's the hard part.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
She pay you much?
How did you know!
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
Without any future?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
Yeah.
Inside stuff?
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
I do?
Thank you.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
Chelsea 2-5598.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
You see any cops?
No.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Yes.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
What would you do, Dad?
We don't have time.
You're absolutely right!
I don't want to learn that!
Sorry.
I still think you should go down.
Hi there.
You scared?
I just don't want trouble.
It's me!
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
I'm here.  Shut up.
There's only one key.
Not lately.
I'm here.
I've got a gun.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
They never do.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Listen--
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Sure.  Lots of times.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Why?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
No.  Why?
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
What, he should see me help you catch him?
He'll be dead when he does.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
Nick...
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
What's going ON!!!
Nick, please, it's me --
Canada.
No!
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
I'm almost done.
He says he wants it now.
No.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
The hell I can't.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You what...
So you could get down her chimney.
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
I never worked at no casino.
She says a lot of things.
What'd they call her in college?
I did.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Why not.
You do.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
No, Gabriel... no...
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
'Tis the season, convict.
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
We're aware of your position.
Mr. Bangs.
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
Acid-chewer.
My what?!
How do we take them out?
Haven't thought about it.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Standing right here, man!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
You're hitting for MY cards!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
I'M NOT NICK!
Yes.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
What?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Bullshit.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
How is he?
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Dead as Dillinger.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Give me my book.
How many employees?
He don't tip.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
I'm okay.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
How can you be so sure?
No shit?
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
I don't know anybody.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
That fuckin did it!
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Thanks.
Why do you think?
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
What?
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
I don't want to run short.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
Yes.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Why?
Can I have my gun back?
I don't care what she asked you.
You want to split up? --
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I can't take her with me.
All right, you didn't know.
I said I didn't care.
What's botherin' you, anyway?
But I want to stay.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Stop it -- stop it.
Well, say it.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
That's the end of the line.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
I feel good anyways.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
Wife?!
I think he wants me.
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Shit!
Let's get a hot dog.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Just wait, you'll see.
My child, you're alive!
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
What are you getting at, Professor?
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Would you please focus?
You do.
Alright, go to the belt store...
I guess so.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Mrs. Sutphin?
He's really cute!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
You scared me.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
We can be real quiet...
You bring me such peace...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
I know Dottie!
...People who don't mind their own business.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
It's not fair!!
I certainly was not!
I do, please.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Certainly not!
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
Yes.
No.
You could go and open the door.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
She can only use cash.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
Redi's all right.
Thank you.
I ought to know.
What were you talking about?
No. She asked about the trademark.
Why?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you do believe me?
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
But I'm not joking.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
And then?
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
They may have been friends of hers.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
That's too bad.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I don't believe it.
Of course.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Oh. Well, please sit down.
Well...
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Lawyers.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Do you want them?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
My therapist said that --
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Are you in the middle of something?
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Why not?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
On tape?
No.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
I'm babbling.
But if you were?
That's very flattering.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
Mmmmm...
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Yes.
He does.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
I guess.
Yes.
Why?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
What?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Questions about sex.
I feel like I do.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
I don't want to discuss it.
Hold on.
Thirty-two dollars.
So will you, someday.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
You just want to ask me questions?
How do we start?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
No? Not even one more?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Afraid of getting caught?
Cynthia. John.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Nothing wrong with trying.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Graham.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Plus first and last month deposit.
What do you mean?
So is my wife, asshole!!
God, you need help.
Goddamit...
May I ask who's calling?
One moment.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
That you, Rog?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Time to check with Flavors.
He needs help.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
What show?
Why?
YOUNG BLOOD
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Do you really think so?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
Foods!
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
So I guess that's it.
Gary.
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
That's what people say.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
That's on us.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Want some?
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Shut up.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
What?
What?
I don't want to talk about it.
Slaughterhouse.
What exactly are we going to do?
No.
It's private.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Keep it elevated.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
What?
Me?
Quite a week.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Hey.
She got anything good?
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Is she sleeping or...?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Like what a fraud he was.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Okay. See you around.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Ken.
So how're you doing?
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
You quit drinking?
Yeah.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
No dad!
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
Clear for what?
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
You want him coming in the house next time?
I heard.
How can you say that?
I'm close.
Edgar, come inside.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
What's two?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Okay.  So he was tall?
I would say so.
Six months.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
...And you had to kill him?
You're in here for winging a guy?
Did it seem short to you?
Didn't Paden tell you that?
I haven't done anything.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Why would they stop you?
You don't know?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
That's the good stuff.
He left me.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I am telling the truth.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- It's called a projector.
Spare me.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Why isn't she with you?
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Why not?
Why not?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Viktor, you should have said something.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Thank you.
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
How much wine have you had?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Because obviously she existed, right?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
What I do to Simone?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Absolutely not!
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
I know what you mean.
-- Please, get away from me.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
This week anyhow.
There was no other way.
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Really?  Too bad.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Why?
Dark?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
Taller?  What?
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
-- What you don't understand --
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
You're a doctor. What kind?
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
Look over there.
She died a long time ago.
What?
I forgot myself.
Dr. Crowe.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Never mind.
I don't know, Cole.
Soon. One week.
You weren't a paper champion.
Yes, I am.
No.
I definitely won't.
Anything bad about me?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Maybe.
A lady. She died.
Yes.
Ghosts.
You think I'm a freak?
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
They used to hang people here.
Like what?
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Not lately.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
I could. You sucked.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
"-- an AXE!"
You know who I am. You invited me.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
I --
Not while you're driving.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Amen.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Yeah?
Getting ready.
Wait a minute --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Never.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
'Mornin', Jack.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
No, Starla! No!
Yeah. Good.
Aspirin.
And this is mine.
We're coming your way, man!
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Out.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
What other stuff?
Hey, look!
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
A what?
Eyes on the road.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Seriously?!?
Would I lie to you?
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Eleven.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Yeah.
You could've asked.
Like what?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
That's me.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Also boring.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
What's your twenty?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Let's boogie.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
How's your twenty?
Now, you just find him, son.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
And a very bad gamble.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
A million flat.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
A Fed? Like FBI?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
Why did you agree to come here?
How quickly?
Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
Oh, that's a relief.
Dead?
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Let's go home.
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You don't love me.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
Rheya --
I'm disgusting.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Neither did I.
Chris --
I want you here.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right.  That's true.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
I came on at 8:00.
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
They're kind of fuzzy.
Could be, I guess.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Tell it like it is.
You could do better.
What do you want to do?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Do you?
It was something my father always liked me to do.
... I don't want to talk about it...
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
Sure we are, let's go!
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
It's not your taste.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Call a cruiser!
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Mom and I got plans.
She's what?
Take care, pal.
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
No…not really.
Flash, drop it--
Harry!
Harry…
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Lemme down, bugface!
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Yeah--
Mr. Jameson--
Mr. Jameson--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Would you cool it already?
How about tomorrow?
Just call me Spidey.
Well...
I hate people with alliterative names.
Thank God.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
I'm sure you kept warm.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Well, no.
Peter-- my condolences.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
What?
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Phooey on that.
I'm not so happy myself.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Coming up.
Who is it?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
We're looking at it.
Don't wear it out!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
105-353.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Betty Grable!
What's the award?
So what? There's other women!
You did?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
That's what I wanna hear.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
You're crying, Animal.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
No. I want to draw.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You can tell Father Murray to --
Give this to Joey, will you?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Give me the radio.
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
That is my wife.
Just don't drool on it.
Where is he?
Then when is he going to Engineering?
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
What do you mean?
And destroy every planet in the system.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
Where is he now?
It's our pleasure.
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
Aye.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Trilithium?
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Response?
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
I still don't...
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
Yes. And I know you.
The ship... Out of danger...?
She's to be decommissioned.
About a dozen officers and men.
With some on the planet...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Then, how --
What must I do?
What I have done, I had to do.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Yes, my lord!
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Say thank you.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I have my orders.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
I know, I know...
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
He's on a build up to detonation!
We encoded four minutes --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
I'm trying, David.
I am truly sorry.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Scotty, let's have it.
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Give the word, Admiral.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
He'll die -- !
Aye...
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
A distinct possibility.
Best we could do in two hours.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Who?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Stop engines.
Scotty!
Aye, Captain.
Gillian --
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Hm?
I'm all ears.
Noon tomorrow...?!
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Here... In the park?
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
You need me.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
But you said toxic.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
Ah... The giants.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
How long, Scotty?
The explosive override -- ?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
If you'll follow me, Professor --
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Most kind, Father.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
This way!
I understand.
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Won't he rust?
And our people?
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Why not?
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Why was Data assigned?
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
What you're doing to my neck...
If that's true, they're a dying race.
You're in quite a mood today.
... I'm not sleeping well...
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Not yet.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
I'm your creator now.
I believe so.
Ready quantum torpedo.
What?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
I'm on it...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Main bus...
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Jean-Luc Picard.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
There's a few of us left.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Something wrong with that?
The invasion plans.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
What?
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
WHAT HAPPENED?
He just tried to save him!
That isn't true...!
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Aye, sir; thrusters...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
We must do this again soon.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
I am uncertain.
Why would they give them to us?
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
An omission. After that -
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
No, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Visual!
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
A computer canna lie, sir.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
No.
Why?
I know.
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
How long is that?
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
To new worlds...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Well then... only one way to go.
Thank you.
With pleasure, Captain.
How could I not?
This isn't real.
Thank you, Commander.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir?
Aye, sir.

What sort of signature?
Captain!
Still well on our side...
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you’ll excuse me.  I’ll be in the gym.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
You know I do.
How did you end up on Remus?
I was lonely...
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Not so long.
It’s too late.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
A matter of hours now.
Silence, Romulan!
No, we can handle this.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
What do you do?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
Thank you.
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
They must have picked it up in space.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
What?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Don't... don't do this... please...
Which way do you want to go?
Dashboard.
Good.
That way.
Pancakes.
Gas good?
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Okay.
Yes.
I want to try it.
You didn't even see it.
A baby is a new person?
Do you have a baby?
Yes.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
No.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
He will.
Yes.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Horses.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
What for?
What will you say about us?
Many, many days and nights...
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Hey buddy... let her go...
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Wait'll you see it.
To the same woman?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
What's all this squid shit?
Yeah, right.
You're going down.
Maybe later.
Jesus.
You talked to Iris?  When?
That's a good one, coming from you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Tell me.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Talk to me about costs, here.
What?  Right Here?
Thanks, Max.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
I won't say anything.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
She never gave me a tape.
Strickland.
Sleaze to peddle.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Fumitsu.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Rams... that's football, right?
No idea.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Something in your car...
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Well, look at the plus side.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Anybody talk to the press?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Let's take a look.
Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
He had an orange hat on.
What kind?
Put a BOLO out on that.
We have another one.
Another what?
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I don't believe this.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
I was visiting an old college friend.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Dick Low's a killer too.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
The man knew how to dress.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
They're all criminals?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
"Gone live?"
This is some serious shit.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I've been thinking about this.
What did you tell him?
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Not the way I can.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
And you're working with him?
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
How are we going to find him?
Sit back.
Who told you about her?
Yeah.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
I talked to him.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
350 miles.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Murman!
You have to put things in perspective.
Shuddup.
I'm sorry?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
I'm Mike.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
It does.
To do what?
Anything?
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
You haven't told then, huh?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
No matter what... like splitting aces.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Why not?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Yeah, hold on.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Really?
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
Oh.  Where is this place?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Oh, like that song...
It's unbelievable.
I got to at least try once.
I'll be your winger.
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
What's dumb about it?
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
He's trying to be an actor.
Rejected?
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Whu?
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
She didn't like me, anyway.
I don't think so.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Don't remind me.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
Aww... He got away?
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
That doesn't matter.
We're not messing with you...
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
You're money.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
I'm not hungry yet.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Like hell I will.
How bad will it be?
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
No.
Sure.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
You understand him better than anyone.
When did he call?
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
You wanted me to be your son.
Then why have I become a man like you?
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Yes.
What is it?
Shhhhh.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
I know about what you mean!
You look good, too.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
How's Mom?
One of them fingered the old man.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Maybe.
Thanks.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Well, we ate everything without you.
Is that good?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Your parents met her.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
He's downstairs.
That's good.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Who is it?
I guess.
What about Christmas?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
What?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I don't believe you.
What?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
I can't later.
Ten thirty?
We'll be there.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Was that Meredith?
Was who Meredith?
Peter, I... I...
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Postmortem?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
November, I thought.
A few days ago.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Yes, mam.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
The moon?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
What's wrong?
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
But... Betsy...
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
With who?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
This is gotta be a game, right?
This I gotta see.
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
No, why?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
I have.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
That's what you think.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Pittsburgh.
Huh?
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Why, thank you Travis.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Physical? Criminal?
So I hear.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
The taxi life, you mean.
Like do anything, you know.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You want to talk about it?
Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
Don't let him do that.
You suppose?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Thanks, I like it.  I think.
And  I love you, Pete!
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
I did?  Huh!
Yes.  Hic!
Oh...
What?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Thanks.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Start with what you knew then.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, then, as what did you go?
I do.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Good to meet you.  Again.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
... Ernie.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
I guess I did.
Aren't you coming?
Huh?
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
Exactly.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Exactly.
Not any more.
Well, that's not what they think.
I can play the piano?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Thank you.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
If you have some, I'd...
I think so.
What do you mean?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Your brother told me.
Darling, of course I do!
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
I don't know, honey.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Yep.
Right across the bay there.
That's where the Brenners live.
Yes?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Birds are not bad!
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
I'm simply quoting the law.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Goodnight, Lydia.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
What?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
No, of course not.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Doesn't what make me...?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Are they moulting now?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Yes?
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
What?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
No.
Yes, I was lying.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Cheers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
With my little sparrow leading team.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
Melanie...
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Maybe.
No... wait.  Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
Hello, Miss Daniels.
And he'll talk?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
With smoke.
I haven't finished my drink.
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
Good morning.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
MacFarlane
Come in, boy -- come in.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
But Richardson?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
No.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
I've ordered nothing from you.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Any attacks of pain since?
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
I'll get him.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
I don't know you, man.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
You mean Alex.
I mean Lauren.
You killed my daughter.
What did I say?
He said he'd prove it.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Yes -- that is true.
That's what I came to see you about.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Yes.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Professor Barnhardt.
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
Where is that?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
I'll say goodnight again.
I don't believe it.
About five months -- your months.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
You still haven't answered my question.
I will be in just a minute.
How do you know?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Is that what you're thinking about?
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
May I see you for a minute?
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
I -- I thought you were--
But how -- how long--?
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
No -- I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
How long will that take?
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
He's a vampire alright.
Fine!  Stay here!
El Vampiro.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
I better get cleaned up, then.
This is Michael.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
You've heard this story before?
Can we get a T.V.?
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Not funny, Sam!
-- a job.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Okay.  Talk.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
When?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Piss off.
I don't know.
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
We'll see...
Now who'd go and do...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
That's good enough.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
We ain't buying that.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
After all this mess.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Bet the last place you ever go.
Get your gear on.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
What?!
Can't hear you.
I'm training to be a high climber.
How did you know?!
What are you?
I'm used to that.
Last night.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
Vox...
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
What's happening to the moon?!
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
A moonstone.
Darling.
Not here... alone.  Please.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
What?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
I know that --
Do you find her?
Yes...
Then you can speak slowly.
Yes.
Or mud carriers.
It's undamaged?
No!
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Do you have it?!
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Here?
That'll be all.
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
What are your people called?
New Yorkers.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
I suppose so.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
I am.  Are you a climber?
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
We never should have done this to him...
Depends on what you're seeing.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
That's too bad.
Temporarily.
You killed him?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
I never touched your father! I swear!
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
Just do it.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
Please...
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
Yes.
They're not.
There're no cars on this street.
Then, where are you going?
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
I'm doing fine.
I never knew my father. Did you?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
I'll die either way.
You have no idea what's going on.
This has nothing to do with that.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Why?
So what am I supposed to do?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
I don't think so.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
I'm sorry.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
What.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
That sounds nice.
What did ya do?
Who's your friend?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Not yet.
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Oh yeah.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
What did Darryl say?
I heard that.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
No.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Well, I just...
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
I... I...
You're right.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Yeah.
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Harlan.
Shoot the radio!
What do you mean?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
It'd have to be pretty good.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What are you talkin' about?
Say you're sorry.
We're fine!  How are you?
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
He implied it.
Loser? You?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Well once. Mary.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Why not?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Hey, look on the bright side --
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
People get hurt that way.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Am I?
What's that?
I beg your pardon?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Well, I'll see ya.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Warren!
You can't be serious.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
So you found Mary?
So she's married?
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Good good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
You mean him.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Who?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
How do you guarantee that?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
Ah, she's okay.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Puffy, get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Huh?
Hi, Ted.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Really?
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What if I can't?
Then you'll call, right?
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Says what, Kenny?
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Yeah.
Not as far as the election goes.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Rug samples.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Oh, yeah -- right.
Sioux Indian, right?
Good. Thank you.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Seven.
You crashed my file?
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
And get rid of the dog.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
You've got no jurisdiction.
He said he doesn't know.
She's your sister?
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
What?
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
So they took care of Leo.
Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Get up!
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
Yes, ma'am.
Two miles.
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
Apology acknowledged.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
How about anything, anything you want to do.
What about the plane?
You don't have to kill it.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
Where?
I'm still second best.
That's what you get flight pay for.
You don't have to do this.
What do you want?
That's what I want.
What kind of games?
That's up to you.
Your watch.
Sir?
This is crazy!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
Okay, okay.
I'm not losing it again!
Oh...I'll think of something.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
Who's your pilot?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Right.
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
The girl with the purple fingernails?
I didn't ruin her.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Figured out what?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir!
Oh, you mean the thrill!
My wife's house.
I don't know...
You think I should quit?!
You may not think so, but you are.
It's not true.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Thank you.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
So why am I still alive?
Do you expect me to believe you?
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Yes, sir.
Come on...put his head in place.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
That's right.
Where?
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
C'mon!
Oh, Rekall.
Well don't.
No shit...
What is it?
What the hell is this?
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Mmmm.....
But I'm always home by morning.
Bye.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Let me finish!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
It's time you found out.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Get out!
Aliens?!
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Do not talk to the driver.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
I am not!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Little sons of bitches.
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
I'm gonna help you.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Yeah, Val.
It does.
An hour after you picked it up!
It most certainly is.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Where's the nearest hospital?
Bellevue. Straight up First --
Sustained.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Oh really?
How can you remember that?
We had a description of the suspect.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
That's why I hate experts.
I'm not that desperate.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
It hasn't been that long.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
See-cil.
Shu Kai Kim.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Calls for speculation.
Badgering.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
What is your rank within La Compania?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
And you b-believe that.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Albert.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Okay, Gordon!!!
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
No, sir, we did not.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
No.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
What do you mean?
How do you figure?
What do you mean?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
That's good.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
The usual, 9:15.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
You got it.
I haven't got it yet.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Send me a kiss.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
I can't tonight.
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
You'd think so.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
What were you doing in my room?
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
Fine.
School?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
No.
I was down the street.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
...tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
You know what that would mean?
Yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
I...
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
Yes!
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I am on the staff of...
It's a common medical term.
Yes? Galvin, right?
Right. Who called?
Yes.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Yes...
One hour.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Not if you don't grow up...
You, you don't under...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
I have to talk to you.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Pardon?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
No.
And ask me what?
...I know. I went...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Yeah.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
What difference can that make...? All right...
I don't want a mistrial.
She told me.
She did?
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Yes.
Let's go.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
He's very excited about it.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
I don't follow.
No biggie, really.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Like what?
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You have a fever, sweetie?
Not sleepy.
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
Right 'cross the freeway.
I'm fine.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Seemed, not was.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
My child?  No...but...
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
We were idealists.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What do you mean?
What?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
It was a bad dream...
Me too.
Who?
What are you talking about.
Face what?
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Why are you here?
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
Long enough.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Sorry won't cut it.
He climbed when he was ready.
Yes, I was.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
May I ask you something?
I am accountable.
No.  I didn't.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
You was in the Marines, huh?
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Whattaya mean family?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Forty bucks...
This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
Why should it?
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Muchas gracias.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
But I'm wild at heart.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
...Asshole.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
See ya downstairs.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
And you never told nobody about it?
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
What kinda trash talk is that?
What's that, honey?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
What's that, peanut?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
More'n likely.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
Went with Bobby.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Shake hands with your daddy.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Just tell me what you want.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
No.
Where?
Santos... I can't...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
The candelabras were my Gran's.
You're welcome.
Your wife.
Mm.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Shut up and drink.
Shit.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Maybe... I don't know.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
He was never able to reproduce them.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
Bullshit.
The last month maybe.
No, really...
Stop calling me Vernon.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
It's not bad.
Really.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
I've got tenure.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
The guy on the phone.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Who?
Maybe...
Where's that?
Amazing.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
No thanks.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Oh. Well. I...
Chancellor.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
All right. This morning --
She's left before...
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Really, Sara, I...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
And the jacket?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I know.
It didn't come up.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Grady?
This is important.
What is it, Grady?
Oh... yeah.
I don't know. It might be...
Taking the long way home.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Foreman now.
Is it because of Anna?
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
Huh?
It's a nice table.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Ah, come on.
Isn't it?
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
I bet you can.
Were you watching me?
It's good to listen to your daddy.
I'm not pretty.
I have no idea.
They grow outside, don't they?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I could take you downtown.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
How come?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
They sound like finches.
Your daddy will always love you.
The job's okay.
I said the job is okay.
A diary?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
It was just an idea.
I'm still thinking about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Honest? No.
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not that crazy.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
We have a lot of work to do.
Do you know what "normal" is?
How do you define it?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
Go home, Walter.
To relax.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Yeah, you.
Neither do you.
What?
You must hate it.
What?
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Because I like you.
The worst?
Yeah.
It's not what you think.
I'm sorry, Walter.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
What?
I love my brothers.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Not ever?
That's not what I meant.
What's your fucking problem?
No way that could just be seawater.
Hey, you okay?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Not for long.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
What do you think he saw?
Cute, Virgil.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
They'll come out after us.
Who then?
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Got it. Over.
I can't... make it... podner.
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Then how come you're not with him?
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
There's no comparison.
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
And why haven't they left each other?
Yes.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
It takes even less.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Do you consider that a compliment?
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Who's moving?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Why don't you try?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
And what did they say about me?
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
From Panarea. Why?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
I would like to ask you something.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Is that far from here?
No.
No.
Agnes...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes...
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Yes Mother.
Yes, Mother.
What do you mean?
What would you like to talk about.
Who?
Oh, yes!
He's told you?
Oh, yes.
How were you sick?
And what happened?
I got sicker.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Would you like some?
Why do you smoke?
One.
No... do you?
Why should I?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
Somebody told her.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
Why not?  Mmm?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
A mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
I breathed!
She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Because I'm in trouble.
Why?
Yes.
Will she be angry?
Hm hmm.
For me to get sick in.
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
So I could go to him.
Him.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No...
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
???
Sister...
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
I can get you new evidence next week.
It's your favourite...
How do you survive?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
... Thank you.
Unfiltered.
What man had access to her?
What's his name?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
I've already told you what I thought.
Who?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
The Catholic Church...
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
And Agnes' father?
Do you know what she did to her?
She molested her!
Her spiritual health.
You just said...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
Why must he be anybody?
She is an innocent.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Where is she?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Yes.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
And the baby.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
He'll be pulp by now.
Spoil sport!
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Wake up!
We do.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
What's that mean?
And cunning.
Out where?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Oh ... I dunno.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
You're only right.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
Yeah ... so what?
Clean though, isn't he?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
So's mine.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Hello.
No, I'm not.
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Who?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
I'll see what I can do.
Take a look.
Sure.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Well, get started.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
It wouldn't come.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
Oh... God...
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Sun will be down in a minute.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Can you see anything?
Is it still dripping?
About four hours.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Good!  Moisture content?
Found what?
Good.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Even simple.
Food-storage room!
By eating our food supplies.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
That'll blow the ship up.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
I'll get you out of there.
It's on the board.
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
That's a fact.
Just got a reading...
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
Yeah, I got it.
Which mean physically going outside.
What's the problem?
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
And before that?
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
I... I can't!
No!
You're more than modest.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Eddie what?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
It wasn't meant to be.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
She doesn't know.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Yes, you did. You still do.
What have you got to do with it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Margo? Lunching in public?
I do not. How do you do?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Naturally enough, your understudy.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Didn't you know?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Bill-
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
As of this moment you're six years old...
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
How is Eve? Okay?
When I'm guest of honor?
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
What's all over?
Who?
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I must have frightened her away.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I've been aware of that for some time.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Why.
Why what?
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Everything.
What did you expect - live sables?
Of course!
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Oh, brother.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Like an agent with one client.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Miss Harrington...
That's all.
Probably not.
I've heard of them.
I don't care if I never get home.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He's the best.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
I think she would cheer.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
Over my dead body...
Thank you, Karen.
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Right here.
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
He's in love with you.
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
You'll be there, won't you.
Loud.
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve?
That was a pity...
What are you going to wear?
Nothing...
- and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
You'd have been proud of her.
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
But that was the fourth straight time.
How about me what?
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Are you breaking the contract?
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--see?--
And?--And?--
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
Hmm?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
Only everything...
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--what time is it?
Night.
I'm on deadline.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
--Deep Throat?--
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
There's always a later plane.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Who were they?
Who by?
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--what do you think?--
OK.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Talk about Segretti--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
How grand?
Security consultant.
Where?
I think so.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
It is.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
A girl. Melissa.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
...okay...
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
Neither did I!
Yep.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
What?  No I'm not.
...yeah.
You can't sing at the competition.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
That's not why we're going out.
What?
You got it, stud.
Do you?
Do you love her?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Just in time.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay, I get it.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
I thought so.
Okay.
Shame on you!
Yes, slowly.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
You got in.
Tonight?
Okay, don't stop.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Bullshit.  From where?
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
No shit.
Yep.
Uh huh.
Would you shut up?
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Like an underground club?
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
A la votre.
I know. He told me.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
No... I...
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
How to read.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Good day!
I'm fine.
Not you. Him.
Who are you?!
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
Anya... where are we?
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
How do you know?
You'd lose your security deposit?
Bartok... a question.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Pray he's color-blind...
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
Rasputin!
No. Empress, you --
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
I did no such thing!
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
This guy's on television.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
The alarm clock.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Well, where is it? I-
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
And I love what you're wearin'.
Well... thank you again.
Neat, yeah.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
think that's, uh-
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Oh.
As Balzac said...
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Yes, it is.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Who cares? Who cares?
M'hm.
Yeah.
Will it change your wife?
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Yeah?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
What thing?
Thing?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Nothing at all?
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
What'd I do?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Why are you so hostile?
Dammit! I was so close.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Tsch, a few.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Trigger.
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Look, uh...
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Where?
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
We're gonna operate together.
His wife has diabetes!
There's a whole wing in this house.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
It has your ring.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Leo?
Not this time.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
What what's about?
It's not going to come up.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Fuck you.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
I adore him.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
You only made half your quote this year.
Hardly...
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
For good.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I'll say as little as possible.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
She left the fucking gate open.
Well he can't have gone far.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It's not like this all the time.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
What are you saying?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
Sure.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Don't I find what?
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Hm.
Scout's honor.
We're way past inappropriate.
Lemon.
Medallions.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
He always has two or three going...
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Don't go in, Ryan.
Are you working on a new book?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Not at all.
The charades.
The Shostakovich.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Very.
Okay.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
Yes.  Fine.
So tell me, how's it going?
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Rose.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
I hope they're watercolors!
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
And the food sucks, I know.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Why are you doing this?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Yes.
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Well...no, but --
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Yes...he's wonderful...
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
So...you two are in love?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Yeah, I know.
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Something the matter?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Oh!
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why?
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Fine.  Wait.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
So I see.
What gave you that idea?
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
I mean -- her apartment.
I don't want it.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
What for?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Over a girl?
What?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Fine.
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Yes, sir.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I am?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
Who else?
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Something like that.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
I'm not sure.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Well, I have things to do --
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Who is Mickey?
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
The party's over.
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Doctor.
Dreyfuss.
Get more coffee.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Important?
Are you sure that's what you want?
I promise.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
All set for what?
Atlantic City?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Lovely. You were a big help.
See if they'll what?
Part.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
None.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
Cook school -- that did it.
Not a thing.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
... he's an amazing officer.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
Who knows what's up there?
Terminate ?
We ain't goin' down the river.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
Do you know that jungle?
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
Haiphong.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
How's the pain?
What are you doing?
I had immense plans.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Yeah... thanks.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What did you hear?
I know.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
C'mon --
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
134  CONTINUED:  
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
Back against the bars.  Now.
She's dead.
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Wait a second.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
That's right.  You're not.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.

Let's get out of here.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
No, I better stay at my post.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I love you.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Since forever.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
His home number.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
My son is sick, okay?
Why did yo do this for me?
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Lovely.
You take off when you have to.
Is there another way to see it?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Can we order first?
Fries.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Sex with Simon?
Yeah... Well...
That seems like a good choice.
I should've danced with you.
Were you asleep?
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
You know what? I...
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
All right, cut me a break.
I'll take care of myself --
No. No. Get Carol.
Two years ago...
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Absolutely.
Ask him.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Yeah...
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
What is this?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Probably.
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
No fucking way.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
We both know what you were doing.
We go around once.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
The contract was stolen.
$1,000,000.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Now you understand why I'm here.
Another contractor.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Just Electra?
How old were you?
Yes.
Are they usually like that?
You said you didn't trust it.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
How was the beach?
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
You didn't take it.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Jesus, if someone had --
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
She was taken.
Why?
Shit.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Shit... oh well.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Right.
How would you like the funds?
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.
But we are underground?
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
It's big, right Jahn?
You got my word on it.
That makes you an expert I guess.
So?
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
I've been saying that since we met.
Can you do the lock on it?
Like helping a sick kid?
We're going to need it all.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Who put a bee up your butt?
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
What?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Some deal you did there!
What are you talking about?
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Yes.
No!
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
How about you Brutus?
Whatever!
You're everything a guy could want.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
What? You are crazy!
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
What for?
Will this thing take long?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
You will wish you hadn't.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
But I have to finish this....
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Just yesterday.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
You are quite sure it's secure?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
About a job.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
He wants to talk to you.
It was.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
-- Obviously.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
So you agree you need help?
I'm an enemy?
Go for it.
Do you think I'm strange?
The world of the dead?
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
I heard what you did. Thank you.
What are you talking about?
That. And less strange.
Twice a year.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
I'm sick.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
That won't be possible.
So talk to us about something.
I'm no dummy.
Please.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
What do you want, Biff?
What do you want, Biff?
I beg your pardon?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
I don't know. National Cash Register?
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Oh yeah.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
You do?
Huh?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
What's this all about?
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
Jesus!
Curious...  Very curious.
A car.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Sure,.
I run this place! 
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
They're okay.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
No, you're not either.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
No.
Well, stop the world.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
I don't know.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Okay.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Yeah.
But it would hurt.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Yeah.
Really?
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Git.
New Jersey?
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Same one you had yesterday?
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Go away.  Let me rot?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
I didn't drop 'em.
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
...Who is this?
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Barton!
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
A week, eight, nine days –
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Well I...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
Go ahead, son.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
And I could tell you some stories –
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
What a dump...
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
I'm at the Earle.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Uh-huh.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
But, you know, with the head still on.
Excellent picture.
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
Yes.
Catherine Tramell.
No, Nick, please --
About a year and a half.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
No.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
She wiped out her whole family.
Didn't you study it in school?
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
No.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
You can make a mistake.
Please.
Why take the risk?
No.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Somebody always does.
Sometimes.
Routine.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Not now he don't.
I don't know.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You don't like punk rockers?
Why the hell not?
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
I said keep it.
Fuck you, too Nick.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Rene's been telling me about your work.
Let's get out of here.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Ten bucks apiece.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
No.
You should talk to him about this.
How about right now?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I know that. Don't let him get away.
Sure, ok..
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
What?
Not black.
Who said that?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Yeah.
Out?
Who am I?
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
You're your own baby.
Pretty much the same.
I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
I'll take the whole tin.
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar – I'll get the rest.
Sure. I'd be glad to.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Wanna Mac?
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
I think I'll take the stairs.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Wrong on both counts.
You're not the Mayor.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Things change.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Weird, huh?
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Yawn.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
Coming on line now, sir.
Oxbridge Academy?
I recognized the accent.
You are going back to school.
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
What are you talking about?
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
I see you knew him.
I wish I knew.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
Our work?
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Is he all right?
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
And another name for Mystery?
Tonight's a good night.
Al?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
Banzai.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Absolutely not.
Fred?
Never heard of a double-cross?
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I'll take you with me.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
About Charles...
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
Ahm.....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?  Well, the truth is - we can't.  So what am I saying?  Will we find her again?  Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Welsh.
Sure did.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
I vote for Bart.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
off the peg?
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Forget it, bunghole!
Cut it out butt-hole!
Uh...
Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Oh, that's nice.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Thrr...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Ah, the witness?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
That's better. Yes?
Who knows?
Uh, Butt-Head.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
No, Jane.
We're rich in what really matters.
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
Adam!
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Two hours.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Who did the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
I didn't --
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
3:30 I guess.
Is this like a trick question?
Really.  I don't know.
No.  What's wrong?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Life is just... too awful.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
I want to get in.
I think so.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
I'm sorry already.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
I see.
Hardly any, Robert.
Oh, really?
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I wish he were here...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
A Black man gave me the message.
Thank you.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
There's no need for a hospital.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Yes. I lost my remote control.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
... Mentor...?
Yes. I was.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Hello, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
Good night, Eve.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Oh, good.
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
... I see.
I agree.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Yes. I like to watch.
I never needed money.
... Oh.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Of course. I would like to look.
I see.
... I see.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
I hope so.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Thank you.
I am a very serious gardener.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
1952...?
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
No, sir.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Tell your friends.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Yeah. Okay.
Seven-ish
We have to make it an early night.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
I'm scared.
I have to go back now.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
No they're not.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I love you so much.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
People make mistakes.
I know.
Schwartz.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Thank you, sir.
No, really.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Tickets to Malkovich?
I'll protect you, Dollface.
I've fallen in love.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Hello. Wendy.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Why are you being like this?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Oh, be still my heart.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No.
Why not? I need to get in there!
Who's calling?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Well what?
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Yes sir
Ya think?
Extra?
Could be that fall you took.
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Might see anything at all at 124.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
I don't know him that well.
Her who?
He knew Baby Suggs?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You planning to do anything about it?
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I don't believe that. I won't.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Make it the way I always do.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Why me, man?
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
But I guess she told Dieter.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Am I wrong?
Well--
I've had a--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Yes, heh--
Separate incidents?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Mm.
What's your drink, Dude?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Huh?
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
Well--sure, I could do that--
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Uh-huh.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Uh-huh.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, but--
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Hey man--
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Huh?
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
We throw the money out of the moving car!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Uh.
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.
Shit!
Yeah?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Bunny.
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Like cancer with a purpose.
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Either that or feeding the worms.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
Scud.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
No, we can treat the wounds --
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Preventive medicine.
There is no cure.
Graffiti --
He will.
You get used to the darkness.
You don't look so good.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Sometimes --
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Go on, I'll be fine!
I'll take my chances.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Closer.
--my God, Nick???
Something was wrong.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
--he's not my husband!
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
--fine, later, fine.
--scared the living shit out of us.
--bullshit!
I know, I know.
I can't let you in.
I want amphetamines.
Both. Now.
Sometimes.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
What? That made her lose the baby?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
--fuckin' A right--
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
I do.
Never would've guessed.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
What're you doing with all this shit?
--Cotter: shut up.
Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
--I don't know.
Yeah. Me too.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
<u>What</u>--
Goes right along with these two.
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--about the Witch--
I am.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Not planning on sleeping at all.
And what's your excuse for being here?
--no.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
--fuck Anna!
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
--yes--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...Huh?
...You ever get tired?
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
Going out with Meurice.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
What night is it?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
For the money.
Nah, I trust ya.
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
For what?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
. my bourbon.
. mommy's here.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
No.
No. What is happening?
Then don't talk about killing.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Beeeee careful.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I did. are you?
What?
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Go where?
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
Good, let's drink up.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
Yeah. Good bye.
I'm here, aren't I?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
... You look beautiful.
Frank!!
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
No Jeffrey!!
Be right down.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Alright.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Motherfucker works fast.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
You'll see for yourself.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
It's your grass.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
No fucking way.
Good night.
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
How are we doing?
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
What?
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
In how long?  A week?
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Mom.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Tough spot.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Good.
I meant every word of it.
What do you guys want?
What about him?
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Are we gonna split up?
Well, here I am.  See?
Dad.
California.
I swear on your life.
It's alright, Dad.
Because she's visiting me.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Who speaks Spanish?
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
I don't even know your name yet ...
I don't do that kind of thing.
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Why?
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
How can I give you this statement?
I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
An inquiry into what?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
Yes.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Your Honor -- please!
Back off, John.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
What about Miss Lawson?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
About a year and half ago.
She left me.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
Yes.
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
We dated for about a month last year.
How?
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
A.M -- or P.M.?
No.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
No pain, no gain?
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
I know.
Yes -- she did.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
It's okay.
Really?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
You can see me now.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
Why?
-- But it's Sunday.
Really.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
What's she like?
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Why did you lie to me?
No.
Why didn't you come to me?
It's more involved than that.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
What?
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
That's it!
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I never knew that.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
I'll get right on it.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Sure.
No, your kids.
Okay.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Francesca?
Francesca?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
But no one in particular.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
I would love to come for dinner.
How about Bari?
Why?
Why do you say that?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, what is this?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
But now that you have it -
Okay.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
What happened?
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
I don't remember!
They're not going to find her!
You people really don't like dogs.
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Just some flies.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Then fuck it!!!
You mean as opposed to your life?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Have you ever been inside?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
Mother!  No.
That place is already bad luck.
And you believe her?
Patrick, he's...
Where is it?
Fuck it.  Alright.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
From what?
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
You was just doing your job.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
But --
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Admit what?
I think you're fucking crazy!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
Stay away!
Give it to me.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
What are you talking about?
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Good idea.
Why?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Where in the hell is he?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
How do I know you are cops?
All right.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Caesar is your husband?
What do you want?
I wanted to apologize.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Yes.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
Is that what you think?
Good.
Why?
What happened?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Shit!  Oh shit!
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
We don't know what we're into!
...they won't let you go...
That's all I get?
I don't know.
Yes.  Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
Oh, Jesus... 
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I want to go home.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
I don't know.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
What?  Like amnesia?
That's what I'm saying.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I thought about it.  I don't know.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I didn't know this would happen.
But the police --
-- there's no time --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
xxxxxx
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
Thank you.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
... get to it.
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
He will be pleased when he comes home.
Well, I ...
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Gillian Layton?
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
You remember Alison?
Christ! You do know it all!
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Er ... no.
Out of kindness.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Say it was a mistake.
I do. Goodbye. 
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Where are you taking me?
Turn around!
What?
Get away!
Turn!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Leave me alone!
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
What a BITCH!
The refund for Tuttle!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
I never signed the form.
What! Shit!
Sam Lowry.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Mistake?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
Who's that? 
No, sir.
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
What?
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
Pregnant.
She say she in great pain.
Es impossible.
In that time, you ever have sex?
I better just go in and see her.
I should be going. I just quit.
You're going to live.
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
You look so different.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
The family know?
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
A medical miracle.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
What do you want to break?
What?
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
What?
You're burned out.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Yeah.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
It's not loaded.
I'll put her on.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
That's your full name?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Call if you get weird.
Eleven and a half.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
Define your terms.
Then what was good about it?
People phoned in.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
No!!!!!
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
This isn't friendship.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Really?
Stop it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Yes?
I spent a fortune on this.
Because...
One's enough.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Me!
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
What?
That's not it.
Where are you?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Okay.  Good night.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Not anymore!
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
I already told you I'm not.
Um...
Whaddya mean?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Honest?
Of course...it's wonderful.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
All about me...
You think I'm creative?
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Forget it.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Sure!
Well...
I-I already got a new one!
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Never mind...
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Huh?!!!
Telling you what?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Why not?
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
You didn't like them.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Yeah?
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
I am so sure.
Water.  Okay.
Mmkay.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
For the dance.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
) What do you think?
Where?
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
How can you keep doing this?
I wish you would.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Football is my life.
Cassandra's really smart.
I don't understand.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Okay, let's go.
Oh, please.
Okay.
Run.
You can learn to like it.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Switch nostrils?
Gimme the God damn ball!
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
I know what it is.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
That's great!
Don't worry.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
We all deserve to wear white.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'll learn.  C'mon--
Yep.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Let me.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
You got me all confused.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
Yeah...you a witch?
He looks great, just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Which one of us?
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
You a God damn witch?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're a cocksucker!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
Yep.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Then go.
Why am I a fuck?
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Fear and ignorance.
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
We'll pray anyway.
We're getting married.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Why are you doing this to me?
That's right.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
All right, take care.
Speeding?
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
You got it.  Schmuck.  All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Mommy.
Matter of fact...
How did Nicky collect?
Hey.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
What?
Then he called me a faggot.
In other words, I'm fucked.
Listen...
I don't wanna come along with you.
Yeah.
Please...
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
It's none of my business?
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
I just told you. She called me.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
No, that's quite all right.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
I'll come by.
...position...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Oh, no.
Good luck.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Why're you crying?
Yeah.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
You can trust me.
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
No, you don't.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
With the money.
He wanted a watch, too.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You threw it away?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
You want your jewelry?
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
All right, I will, I will.
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
I really think you're -
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
Well, I... I never tried.
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
You gotta go back out there.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Hi. Good.
I'll to the FBI!
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Hey!
Yeah?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Uh-huh.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Yeah.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
Yeah. Uh-huh -
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
What about my money?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost?
I am.
God... I wish you...
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Right.
Incredible.
Yeah.
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
She asleep?
Every night, on the couch.
Yeah?
What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
They'll do it.
Take it easy!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
That's enough.
I'm sorry.
I know it, I know it.
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
What did you think?
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
You're serious?  You'd help me...
She has a real spirit.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Even the skylight?
Why am I still troubled...
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
And...your point?
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
You think so?...Selina?
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Stop.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
You are...
Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Okay, deal.
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Trust me, you won't have to.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
That's your "rep."
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Then hang up!  Do it!
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What are you doing now?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
Sometimes I paint.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Not a chance.
Don't say that.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
What's going on?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Did you hear that click?
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes sir.
Hand me the phone.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
A typical fuck-up.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You, I would've noticed.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's your point?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
Call me "Nels."
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
There's two police cars now.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
In your dreams.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Hold on.
Let her tell you.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
He's what she should run a mile from.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
See what, Dil?
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Persistent.
Hi.
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
Not in my experience.
The accent, I suppose.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
You on the game?
You can't leave me then, can you?
No, I didn't --
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah.
I'm thinking of your man.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Apologies, my sweet.
So I'm sorry.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
You can always pretend.
No.
Not here.
Kind of.
I can't.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
What?
No! I'm going home...
My pills...
Don't go like that.
Stop it, Dil --
Try and go, then.
Anything.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
What happened to Jimmy?
Will I see you again?
You know her, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Did you give him it?
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
He's hot.
Eddie and Tinker died.
No, what is the thing?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
I know that.
And who is she?
Aye, I do, Peter.
A hotel?
So it's on the street.
My pleasure.
No. It's the truth.
Why can't we?
And you know the funny thing?
She's a friend of mine
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Best game in the world.
Hurry up, would you?
Shut up, would you?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
My special friend.
Some kinds of women are...
I'm sorry.
Like the one about the frog?
When I was a child...
What does that mean?
Tell me something, anything.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You never know.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
Yes, but --
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Relax -- you're gaining.
You're going to look for him -- now?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Let's look anyway.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Can you remember anything at all?
Look.
Then who did? You're the only one left.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Very sweet.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
No, thank heaven.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
What's your first name today?
Brian.
You'd lie about anything.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
The view had better be worth it.
Your --
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
There must be some way.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm sorry.
Alex --
What? Assassinate somebody?
No --
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Shut the door!
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Forty-five thousand.
And the last one?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
Here's ten.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
What do you want?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
And this? And this?
No -- in my room.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
I'm not sure I --
Shakespeare never said that.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
Who said?
How do you shave in there?
What?
The man you had the fight with.
How do you know what they're doing?
But what?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Calm down Brent.
Daddy you scared me!
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
No honey.
No I wasn't.
She works at a church?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Why?
Ok.
What are you doing here?
I'm sure you should have failed.
Of course I'm scared.
Yes.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
I won't.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Don't you think it's sick?
Why?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'll think about it.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Yeah.
I need to ask you something.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
His mother's side.
His mother's an only child.
And she didn't?
So are you.
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?

 There's gotta be...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Thank you very much.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Three seconds.  One...
And it won't be pleasant.

Hey!

No, sir.

You look fit...healthy...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Mm-hm.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
...always done, Richard?
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
And let me guess.  You failed.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.

None.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
That's a filthy habit.
Why?
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
No.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
I want the rest of the pictures.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
What?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
I was grateful.
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
It has to do with my father.
Then let's go talk to her.
What about?
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
I want to see her.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine.
To Mexico...
I have to go home and get my things.
He didn't wear bifocals.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Don't know her. Take a number.
And Mulwray isn't?
Only when I breathe.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Of course not.
Then go home and forget about it.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
No, you have a press agent do it.
She ran away?
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
That's for sure.
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
It tastes wonderful!
Too bad!
What's she like? What's she like?...
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
Elena. My name's Elena.
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Somebody stole it.
You never used to do that!
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
OK...
I didn't see that.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Yes -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Who said anything about brooms?
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
Certainly not.
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
September the ninth?
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
No.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
Oh, me -
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Half past eleven.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Do you know what that is?
It's been a tough day.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
I'd like that.
Yes?
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
He married you, didn't he?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
Am I sure?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
It's not the same.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
He went home to change for the big date.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Such a sordid state of affair.
He was?
Train. It took eight hours.
Look how full of yourself you are.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Let me take you out tonight.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Sang.
You're such an asshole.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I left like an hour ago.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Call the police.
Just me.
Pack of cigarettes.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Peptic ulcer.
Yeah.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
That's cheating?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
That's frightening.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
And you figured it out?
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
And the second time around...?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
All of them.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Why'd you apologize?
I know.
We're not playing in the street.
Then where're we gonna play?
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
Twenty-two; same as us.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
That's embarrassing?
No!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Just... go! Go open the video store.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
You work in a video store!
What?
Not yet. 
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Holy shit. That girl?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
I'm happy.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Fuck you.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Lovely story.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
THE GLADES MOTEL?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
How do you know that?
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
I should start.
With you? I don't think so.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
The white kind.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Bunch of savages in this town.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
I was kidding.
Something wrong?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
What do you mean?
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
You sucked his dick!
This is different. This is important. How many?!
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
Goodbye, Dante.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
It was only a few times...
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
WHAT?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
I beg your pardon!
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Which one?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Fuck you.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Where's the radio?
You're getting warmer!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I love you, too.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
Nice and easy...
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
What are you doing here!?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
For the same reason you did, to help.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Never could save a thing.
What are you talking about?
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Ask the questions.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Good morning, Walt.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Been punished, yeah?
I've been cured.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Yes. They want to help.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
What crime did you commit.
No, sir, I feel really great.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Oh, aye, aye.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Do you mean Church of England?
Fair hair, sir.
Yes, sir.
We're going to friends now, sir.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You've heard Beethoven before?
I haven't seen you before.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Are you feeling better?
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
You got a deal.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You need a vacation.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Twenty five?
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
Vincent...
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
Oh.  Sorry.
You should start a union.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
Yeah.
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
Two...
How long, you figure?
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who was he?
Yes, Max?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Why?
In case he asks.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
You had to kill Heller?!
Yeah, that.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Just drop me off.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Not for years.
Motive?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
I think you're different.
No.
You bit someone's nose off?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
What is?
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Who?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Uh huh.
That was him.
What van?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
What's in Connecticut?
Come on.
Did you kill my father?!
Then tell me what happened.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Don't do this.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Whatever.
And you have no idea where he lives?
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
A dog.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
No.  Not yet.
Yeah, I do.
Where do you think Jerry is?
That you come with me.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
You're --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
How can that be?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
Is that your official response?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
The librarian... or the library...?
What kind of deal?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The systems integration site.
-- of Hadden Industries.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
You too.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
How long was I gone?
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Did you love him?
If you came back.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I don't follow.
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
Thank you.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
I can't hear this now --
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Git movin', I said.
I got two years.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Yeah.
That's good: he earned it.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Ram it in and break it off!
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Yes, Boss.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
She's got him! You hear that?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Borrowin'.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
A cold drink? Okay?
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Luke. Where you goin?
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Cuter.
Well, how far didya get?
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
The same as the first time...
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
You know where.
I think this is number three...
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
How do you know that?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
They get fan letters...
Maybe you should...
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
She on the passenger side?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Okay.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Oh, I know.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
What about her arms?
Right.
Good.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Give me Ruben back...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
We were together six years, sir!
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
It is?
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I'd like to go back. James...
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Really?
I didn't say...
You've only known Jake a few months.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
Yeah?
Lie?
I'm glad.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Anything interesting.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Not a one.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Open up.    I want to see.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Do you like it?
You, too. Kick ass today.
Promise?
The restaurant, too?
How about a dance?
What do you want to do?
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
That's a big question.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I've met someone else.
I'm really sorry.
I'm glad you're doing well.
What does that mean?
I'll float you.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
You don't trust me?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Okay.   How much?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I only have your word for that.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Cops?
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
You didn't buy batteries?
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Has to be.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
I'm from Belgium.
A thousand dollars?
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
-- Did you set it up?
Yeah, French guys from France.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Oh yeah.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
Go where?   The police are outside.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
No!
They sort of got away.
No.   It's mine.
Oh, you think?
What?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You wanna tell him?
No.
After last night I could say the same for you.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
I'll give them to you.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Never!
Give it back!
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
Have you questioned him yet?
I knew she would intrigue you.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
I'll look around and catch up later.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
This is a delicate matter.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Mister Funboy lives there?
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
No.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
She's still dead.
Mom tried to cook.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Murderer.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
You don't even remember...
Yes.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Who got himself what?
The night is young.
You might say that.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
You did?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
A friend wrote me.
Great book.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
Who?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What?
You must take me for a real idiot.
It was perfect.
Sure.
What are you saying?
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
I don't think that bothered him.
What do you mean?
Okay.
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
What do you mean?!
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Well what then?
No, you were fine.
Don't you want to change that?
Same time next week?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
Who is this?
Where is she?!
I'll be right there.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Sounds intriguing.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
It would feel so yummy.
I'm working on it.
Loser.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Yeah.
Exactly the opposite.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I'm not in the mood.
I want to fuck.
No, I'm not.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Come again?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
And if I don't?
I'll do my best.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Annette! Annette!
Yes, you already did.
I did?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
She really loves me.
How will I get to her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
You bastard!
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
How?
Sometimes.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
Times have changed.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
It's your play.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
But I told her to go with you.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Where did you mail them?
But wishes don't come true.
It's true.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Yes, Amy?
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
I've wanted a friend.
Whenever you want.
That's right!
I shall wear it in my hair!
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
It's a pretty ring.
Soon as I finish.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Can we get some service here?
No.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Yeah but they looked cool...
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Does she have PMS?
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
No, did you fuck him?
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
What the hell is the tampon test?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
You're just saying that.
I think he called you beautiful.
It is so hot in here.
No you don't, believe me.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
And he was missing an arm.
Okay, I gotta go.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Why the fuck would you do that?
The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
You never say that.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
No.
It's Mark.
On your desk.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
Intriguing?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Okay, you busted me.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You didn't say it.
They do? Oh no...
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
Oh my god, what happened?
What makes you think I was the last one?
How big?
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
You can't believe this bullshit.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
And fifth, you're dating her.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What of?
Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Just visiting my patient.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Loose ends?
You are mistaken.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
A hunch.  He might be able to...
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Maybe.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Not that again...
Why?
Don't say a .
Is this dangerous or anything?
You're kidding?
Oh... Okay.
Don't worry about it.
And we're going away for a holiday.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
TilT we figure something out.
Exactly. A condition.
I was a senator, you know.
Three years.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
I'm going to kill him.
I'll lock him away for good.
This is undeclared income.
I'm not sure.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Well -- take care.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Extend things?
Oh my gosh...
What?
Alan...
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Of course.
I had a feeling.
Uh...
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
You have a lot of secrets.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I know.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
I sure fall for some weird guys.
We're doing our best, sir.
What about the intro?
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Leave him.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
The hospital? 
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Actually I don't
Don't come.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Women swoon!
Knox, you gotta calm down.
I'll tell you later.
Oh come on, Pitts...
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
But I thought-
I told you, that's a secret.
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I'm in.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Knox, you're crazy.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
But I love you.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Uh-huh.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
I have something.
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Yes sir.
The god of the cave.
Todd Anderson.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
But if he said no before then...
What is that supposed to mean?
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
Oh..
I'll come to the performance.
That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
Do you have to quit the play?
Which question is that?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
Shut up!
That's where my boat's moored.
Just trying to get to my boat...
What are you people talking about?
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Anti social?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
You're saying they can think?
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
And what if I run into one of those things?
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Joey...look at me...
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
Line it up now, nice and easy...
I have been.
Joey...
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
I know, but...
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Married?
But you must come in.
No, I --
You are frightened, no?
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Everybody love Linda.
Thanks.
How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.
Naw.
No?
Sal's alive???
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Sure.
I don't know.
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
What?
Nick.
Who the hell knows!
There's Vince!
Fucking A.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Merle --
I'm doing that too.
You're right... Okay, you're right.
What do you mean?
Merle...
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
No!!!?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Yeah.
Where?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
What did you say?
Avon Lady!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I'll be alright.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
Ooops, I forgot.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
I'll be okay.
Yes, sir.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
We're partners, aren't we?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
But he was such a good cop.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
You could always take it off.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
We will --
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Jabez! Careful --
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Guess there will, if it says so.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Afraid ... of what?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Opportunities?
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
What -- what's on your mind?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Why not -- ?
Your butter money?
Mary -- it's gone.
Jabez!
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
I'd love to.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
It shows on your face.
Jabez!
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
What's that you say, Son?
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
Coming, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Hullooo!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
You mean -- a jury trial?
Married.
The past six months.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
Uh, what do I call you?
Two?  Are you sure?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Yeah.
What about the kids?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
It's my only chance!
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
You think it over, Leon.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Okay, give us the women.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Believe me, I'm on your side.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
I don't know.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
What now, Sonny?
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
My body?  What for?
How'd that happen?
We're not there yet.
Everybody!  Back here!
Let's move it, goddamn it.
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
I forgot she's in here.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Sonny - Here's your document.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
We can't stay here.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
What about your toe?
There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]

Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
I was a musician.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
Real good.
I be.  I'm living large.
Talk to me.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
My brother.
Yes?
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Have you noticed something about them?
Jade, I still love you.
Ask Sal.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
You the man.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
I thank you.
Wake up!
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Yeah, me too.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Where we goin'?
You keep it.
Christmas came early.
Then we'll do something else.
Meda.  Meda.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Tina, it's not like that.
I am a man.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
HATE!
Good.  I want you to listen.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
'Bout time, Pop.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
What? No! Look.
Right.
So boys, how was your first day?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
No, it's a treasure map.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Oh, is this your special place?
The second R is silent.
Who's Captain Rob?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
No.
Put some ice on it.
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
I kinda screwed things up.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
Who?
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Try one in a million!
Hey, where'd you go?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
You know I do!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Or maybe crossing a river!
Oh wow. Look at you.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
This band sounds terrible.
Nothing.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
They said you were dead.  They said...
My Lord?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
SILENCE... SILENCE.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
No.  I don't work here.
Huh?
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Don't you bave a car?
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I don't understand.
Who do I play?
"It is my home."
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Really?
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I was thinking about killing myself.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
This is the big moment...!
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Ed, it was only one review.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
No!  A horror movie star!
You met Basil Rathbone!
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
That's ridiculous.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
I understand you just moved here?
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Yeah.  Exactly!
That's not true --
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Would that work?
But Greta say --
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
Are you a fruit?
There's still a sex-change --
I just picked them up on the way over...
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Bela died.
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
The sun.
My chiropractor!
Let's get married.
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Who?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Anything good?
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
Where is she? Is she all right?
Okay, I'm nuts.
So?
You know what would be great?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
No, uh...
Great line.
This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Really? They were..
I ... don't know. I ...
Right, right...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Yeah?
No. It's a mess.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
She left.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
She wouldn't tell me.
No, I mean...
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
You batted or you bunted?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Who's in it?
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Dynamite is dangerous.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Can't we just --
Yeah, well...
Saturday, I think we should
There's a list.
Really? 
Are you all right?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
No... Could you?
The what?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
What?
Screw off.
Oh, Jesus.
What's the dif --
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Great.
Ray, come an--
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Me?! That's you!
No. Am I supposed to?
Hi.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
In love?
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
He likes it.
You guys have fun?
So nice
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Should we get a what?
We'll let it run awhile
Sherry... I love you.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
And she's super-nice
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
Larry, you just take it easy
So?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yes.  But do you know?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
I'm not sure.
We talked.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Lynn.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
At least not anymore.
What about him?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
No.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Believed what?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Gone.  Not a trace.
But you were business associates?
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
No.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
His blood's always up.
I'll break them, sir.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What are you talking about?
Really?  What did White say?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
When?
Where is he?
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
What's wrong, Trash?
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Oh Jesus.
Nothing.
You're not.
Listen to me--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
I'm doing a transfer now.
Told by whom?
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Who was that other guy?
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
What do you mean?
How do you know so much?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
They're here.
Where?
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
You sure?
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
How fast can you learn?
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
C'mon.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Are you sure about this?
With what?
It's a little late for that.
I'll say.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
About the accident.
I can't.
Because I don't know.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
To buy lingerie.
It's okay.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
That was for Christmas.
I was missing you.
It's a brand new card.
It's not?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Oh.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
DePinto?
Why would I--
You got a minute?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Bullshit.
We're screwed.
Tell me about Brill.
I've never met him?
Yeah.
--otherwise we may have to--
--otherwise we may have to--
Fuck you. You may have to--
My shoe?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
I don't under--
Oh, well, that's true.
Fuck off.
Are those my Christmas presents?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Alright!
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
They only took electrical appliances.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No. No, it's okay.
Yes. But we can't.
Get it.
The originals?
Sir--
We believe?
Dean's with Lyle.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
How'd you get in the building?
Yes sir.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
I do not.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
No, but I think I do.
No.
You sew very badly.
Now.
What?  No!
No.
It's a folk song.
Yes.  A different wife.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Dance with me.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
There you have me.
Very well.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I can get in the back.
Oh, all over.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Are you planning to be the exception?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Top Hat.
I see.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Yes.  Dropping off.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Are you crazy?
Really?  That's sudden.
I don't think it's indifference.
I don't think so.
Yes, for your hair.
I follow the wires.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
When he dies I'll catch up.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I'm feeling old.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
You got a better idea?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Then don't.
I have a proposal for you.
Uh, yes.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Where's my bag?
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Nice spot.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
That's because I wanted them to!
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
Terrified. Still am.
The Mask.
The big job.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
We're doing it tonight.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Get out of here!
I'm not leaving without you.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
You mean the seven billion.
Gin, really.
In the van.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
The key to success is using the right tools.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
You are a miracle worker.
It's too soon.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Thought you had to use some of these.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What do you think?  What's this?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
And you can't?
It's not about working hard --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
You think there's more?
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
What?  Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
Uh-huh.
And if you had to guess ...
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Nope.  Maiden.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
In the conference --
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Right.
I didn't say that.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
I can't leave my job, George.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Soon, Lord Vader.
Ben ... Ben ...
I feel The Force.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Yeah ...
You know the Jedi Master?
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Try and control this ...
You're going to attack them?!!!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
That depends.  Where are we?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
A mining colony.
You look great.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Me too.  I was afraid.
What are you talking about?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
What's in there?
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
And I too.
I'll die first.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
You told me he was dead.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
That's the deal.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
The name's Plissken.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
No screamin' shit.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Move aside!
Of Merlin?
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
What book is that?
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
What is it my child?
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
I?
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Well what's wrong?
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Just five or six people.
Why don't you let me?
Sure you won't change your mind?
It's serious?
No. Not at all,
Want to ask him?
I just heard them Karl.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
What man?
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
She used those words?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Sure did.
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
You wouldn't.
To begin with it could make things worse.
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Father?
No.
You know how?
Here I'll show you.
You think?
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Hi Father.
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Another one. Had your lunch?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
La plume de ma tante.
Merrin! Merrin!
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
But deliver us from the evil one.
O'Lord hear my preyer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
I once did a paper on it
Unlikely.
Very much.
Do you have an appointment?
How old are you?
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Honey ...
Oh.  What do you do?
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Count it.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
You look awful.
Why the interest?
So do I.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
You'll see.
We don't get a gig.
Yeah, okay.
The hell you don't.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I didn't get her number.
It's not gonna hurt you.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
So what do you think?
Day.  Wednesday.
Sunday.
All night?
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
What the hell are these?
How come I didn't hear anything?
Celebrating.  Join me?
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
February?
You always threw up.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
I can't make the tenth.
Be reasonable, Jack.
What channels it on?
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
Good choice.
The flu.
What do you mean?
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
You're an hour and a half late.
When we know.
What-?
Changed?
Right.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Yeah.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
All I said was you were good.
Sure.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
You sending me home?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Yeah... No.
So ... ?
I didn't want to wake you.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Ever go to church?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
For being one helluva guy.
No.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
What do you mean?
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
I mean like protection.
That's your name, isn't it?
Get rid of them.
You can't blame me for trying.
What's that?
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Back then -- who wasn't?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
It’s okay, Alan. I get it. I’m in your shoes, I’m thinking exactly the same thing...but here’s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it’s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they’re gonna send their kids to college.  It’s just people...
What about me?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
Got it.  Good tip.
Mom liked it.
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Great room...
I don’t think so.
Kate’s my wife...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
Me?
What?!
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Please.  Just tell me what’s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Why not?
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Something like that.
Thanks.  To you too...
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
What?
Yeah...fine.
Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
...my feet are hurtin’...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Excuse me?
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
You had a heart attack?
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
I think it may help us but there’s a slight chance it could make things worse.
Worse, you mean...
Way out...
Think bigger.
A perk for what?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Annie goes to a great school.
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
Jack.
Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Is there anything I can do for you?
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
You'd never know it.
<u>Should</u>?
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Go back to the drawing board.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
Is it safe?
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
I can go hotter!
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Hilarious.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
Never better.
What in the world would give me that idea?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
As part of the Crew.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
You may learn to like it.
Now I know...
You can't --it's too dangerous --
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
At an operation?
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
On the Repeater.
Where's my daughter?
Is this a fucking joke here?
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Can I see your license and registration please?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Oh, yah? Twin Cities?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Oh, yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Uh-huh.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Know who this is?
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Where're you going?
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Carl somethin'?
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Oh, yah?
No way.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Uh-huh.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
No, I didn't...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
...Mike Yanagita!
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Prowler needs a jump.
Thanks, hon.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
I love you, Norm.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Where's Tyler?
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
No, I wasn't aware...
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
It means it was homemade.
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
What?
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Should we?
It's for men.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
So you're staying in tonight?
What the hell are you doing here?
No.
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
You're afraid to say.
Answer the question!
What... ?
I'm sorry, I...
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Yes.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Oh, yeah.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
No, supply oxygen?
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
All gone.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Me?
Anyone?
Show-off.
Doesn't matter.
He was obviously able to handle it.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
I said I promise!
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
A liposuction clinic.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, I'm not...
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
Nothing.
"Applicant?"
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no.
I quit.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Why what?
You need me.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Noooo, please...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
What?
You told me you'd say that, too.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Too much school.
I...I...
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Maybe.  What's this about?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Most kids never have it happen.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
That's a plan.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Design?
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
Batteries not included.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Nothing we can do, man.
I suppose you have...
You comin'?
Duck soup.
Forget it.
Let's go.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Where?
I'm not jumping blind.
Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
You're not.
Yeah.  Big time.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Do I look like I have someone special?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
The moron?
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
No... it's just...
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
Tragedy?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
You can ask.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Yes.  They're free.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
No... thanks... Listen --
Hi... Where are my shoes?
The Little...
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What are you doing?  Give that back!
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Happily married, probably.
I don't like horror movies!
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
What are we about to do?
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I leave it to you.
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
You're the pathetic one, not me.
Now, hand...
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
I don't, huh?
You got any change?
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
He's had two strokes.
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Why are you being so mean?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
The day after tomorrow.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Shut up...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Not at all.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
Well, she was.
Yes.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Then don't go out with me.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Victor.
Of course.
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
That's it?
I did.
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
Wha'?
C'mon.
She lives near Eddie?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
A bad attitude.
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Positive.
Nothing.
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Oh, thanks.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Mrs. Smith.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
There is?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
Okay. Some idea.
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Fletch...
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
You gonna nail the chief?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Where am I?
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I agree.
Till then.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Wait a second --
Harry S. Truman?
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
That's Brazil.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You sure those doors will be open?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
You sure got the hard part.
Maybe.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
Cute thing.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
How come?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
I recommend it.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
What...
Yeah.
My secretary.
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Oh... I have some questions.
So you...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Exactly.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
You're not funny.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
Why have you come to my planet?
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Okay.  'B-y-e!
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Go on, another time, another place.
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
What about Don?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Hey, the poet...
It is to us!  It's computerised.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Everything is everything.
B.O.C.A.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
I wasn't looking.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Comment va-t-elle?
Who financed it?
What?
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Names.
Where from?
Yeh?  Who else?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Strike out, eh?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
Never trust a nigger.
The greaser with the blonde.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
Four.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
Hey, bud.
You alright?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
The usual.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Glad to hear that.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
Uh huh...
What?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
October 12, 1969.
It's Mom.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
It's not your fault, Dad.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Sully!  Is that you?
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I'll think of something.
Be a man, man.
You go ahead...
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Maybe.
You're the boss.
You're wrong.
Great.  Just great.
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
I wish it was.
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
No.
Why?
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
Are they grown-ups?
But what I get scared again?
Look --
Look, I don't want your money!
It's going.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
I mean really never.
I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
A pizza?!
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
I guess not.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
Perfectly.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Just felt a little chill.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Hi, Sean.
But Rennie...
Big mess every time.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Alla puttanesca.
Press a button and they give us money.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
What was it like?
I think we Nought to wait.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
No, we're not.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Mystery. Deception.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
It violates so many trusts.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
One more out.
Since when did that matter?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
You're not making sense.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Mine was cobalt blue.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
So does Elliot.
One more time.
Is it true?
But you're his friend.
Home.
No one's waiting.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Some of it good, I hope.
Did they take your clothes?
"Hell!"
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
No, no -- just a moment, please.
We must end the campaign.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
That's when you take advantage.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
All right. Fine.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
I like football.
It would be five thousand more.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
You wish.
What <i>is</i> that one?
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
Michael's.
Not bad, Jerome.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
Not that.
I was at home.
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
Who are they?
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Where do you want to go?
I want to take a walk.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Whisky and a peach.
I didn't. I just waited.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I see it...
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Do it my way.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
We got this far.
I guess you're right.
I don't see how.
Can we make it?
Who was it?
I guess we are.
Yeah. I got out.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Where we go in1?
What's it to you?
You serious?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Yes.
How?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What did he say?
What?
What about?
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Brumby!
I can't.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Do you?
Sid Fletcher.
No, do you really?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
And what was that?
What girl?
Your brother? What you talking about?
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Wilton Estate.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Who's Brumby?
Get knotted.
I see.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Ta-ra.
You're a bastard.
Eric. Eric Paice.
Funny, that.
Oh, that's nice.
It would be. If they were still living.
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Deadbeats all.
Well, I think I had one once.
They did.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
The nurses?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What hard part?
Just the act.
Men come work for you...
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Talking about it as a...
Not actually, no.
We are?
Is that what I said?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
That's right.
Is that what I just said?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Yes.
Clear...
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said he filed...
What?
A waste of time?  Why?
Yes.
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
Thank you, George.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
Under him?
Moss.
You know what those leads cost?
Then put me on the board.
And fifty bucks a lead.
Now.  Yes...When?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Mmm.
What?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Was it?
I've got the check...
John: John:...my daughter...
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
From the store.
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
That's right, Shel.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
Go ahead.
No, his wife is.
Me.
Ricky...
Why did she do that, Jim?
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
You tell me again.
We're going to speak to her.
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
What...?
What...?  Say the words.
You going to turn State's?
You closed him yesterday.
I...
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
That's right.
Yes, thank you.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
No.
Tom is right.
The children can stay.
No, Dad.
The child cannot harm you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Mio fratello.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
Within the compound will be fine.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
Sure, Mikey.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah, it was once.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
No strings.
Do you gamble?
Do you owe markers?
Why too late?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
We do favors for each other...
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
Let him gamble.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
I deny his every charge.
Says who?
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Some water.
No, she's here.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
The Master is waiting for you.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Yes!  You know?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
And your name is --?
Just that I was in the Marines.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
All right, I guess.
I liked it.  We all did.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
What way might that be?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Better work.
Oh no.  I never swim.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
I don't hear anything.
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
The Great War?
I'm very sorry.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
What rumors might those be?
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Of course.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Right.
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Who do you think?
The business has changed...
How ya doing?
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
One more night --
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
How's that?
Something like that -
Your girl works in there ...
Double-meaning intended --
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
What color?
It's arright ...
Dignity...
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
No.
He's in some trouble ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
You remember that, Kip?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Yeah -
About what?
Hey, now -
You can handle it?
You?
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Otto called -
What era was that -- ?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
No problem -
We're going shopping -- !
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Buy you a drink?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Hey -
That's what I want ...
Oh. Okay. Right.
No. Open her ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You treated me like shit.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
Jezuz Christ!
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
I can't do it anymore.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
You know. The stuff I left.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
Jimmy.
There are cops all over the place.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
How?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
You're fuckin' good.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
No, I had to talk him down.
How you doin'?
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
You caught that, huh?
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
--But--
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
It's an integer proof.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
Is there someplace we can talk?
I'll be okay.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Come in.
I got one of those too.
So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
You're right. I know.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Hence, the word remarried.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I guess.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Good luck.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
Then let's go have some fun.
Clearly.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
Come one Will. I just want to know.
So, do you play the piano?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
How do you know that?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
I'm not honest?
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
I never cared about that.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
People done it. If they could, we could.
Fan-belt's shot.
Kids?
Two and a half cents.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Joad. Tom Joad.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
What you mean?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Hush!
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Stand by the door.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
She'll be awright.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Look, Ma!
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
We gonna take whatever they got.
Man bones?
I never--
Yes I do.
--No.
I'm Martin Blank.
What?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Insane.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
It's always the little things.
Bad experiences.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
It's something I do...
You're a government spook?
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Come on.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
It's only natural....
Up on the right.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Is that right?
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
Okay.
Nope.
I don't think so.
Yup.
He using her.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
Paul?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Thank you.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
That's good.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Feel good?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
I don't care! We'd be together.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I didn't see it.
You're right. Good.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Tom?
Yeah, you know everything!!
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
So do you.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Why did you go?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Good night.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
You want to take a walk with me?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Yes, it does.
Well, of course, right...
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
What?
Diane!
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
She's an editor.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
It's never too soon to start.
No!
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Sometimes.
Cool?
Don't move!
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
That's bullshit.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
No.
Okay. Let's go shopping.
We did it!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
If I win, you become my slave.
I know, I know who wrote it.
How?
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Alright, let's boot up.
Dreams?
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Cancer?
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Joey, Joey...
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Congratulations.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
555-4202.
When did you find this out?
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
No, you don't understand.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
I'm not calling the fire department.
Check him out.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Dad, what's going on?
Why?
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Right here, Ben.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Least I'm not alone.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Huh?
I have a place for that.
Bye.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Here, Lester.
I don't know.
Come with me.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
Lee Brackett.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
See you.
What about the rest of my comic books?
Promise?
Yes.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
She's washing her clothes.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
If you say so.
Only minimum security.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
I couldn't if I tried.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
No, he called late last night.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Yeah.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Hi.
Where are you headed?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
I'm...all right.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Did you ever read this one--?
What are you doing?!
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Lee... uh...
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
Aren't they great?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
No.
No, nothing.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
It was on your shirt!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Yes, please.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Y-yeah.
Oh!
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
...you know?  I, uh...
That's a beauty!
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
I know, no--  I know.
I hope.
Well, I just came from an audition...
You got it.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
I remember you.
Yeah.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Nobody ever said it.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
Hmm.
Yeah.
Oh!
Hi.  How you doin'?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
I'm going to tell you later....
Some museum director disappeared.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
...they did it for a lark.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
...his family has offered a large reward.
Impossible.
...what a world.
Why did he come back?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
...young boys, still...?
Mmm...
'fraid it's too late.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
I'm an orphan.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Give it up.
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Why did you look at me that way?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Enchante.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
We got KittyKat...
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
Sir, with all due respect....
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Spoken like a Protestant.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
The shape of a Three.
Thank you.
...but:  this particular statue...
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
...would you use a small word?
Yes.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Did you wait until you were 18?
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
No.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
You are the prince of the darkness.
Say Hi for me.
Your Secret admirer?
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
Uh-huh.
It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Probably.
What do you want me to say?

Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Because you're an idiot.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Don't think.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
But she couldn't handle it.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Jealous much?
Give it up girl!
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
That's good. Have you done this before?
Incredible similarity.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Don't move! I'll get him back!
Remember he's left-handed.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
But my name's not...
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
Mummy!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
Yes . . .
Mummy!
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
All finished.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
What?
Getting paid for doing shit.
Someone special.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What's the difference?
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Eighty four.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
What?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Hey buddy!
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
I surrender...
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Often, uh.
You mean John Bubber?
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Nothin'.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Lie, you mean...
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
Bodybuilding!
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
What's "cynical"?
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
What toys do you have?
I'm looking for some perfume.
And the rent is okay?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
Well, can I make an appointment?
What happened?
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
I'm thirsty.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
Stop knowing me so well.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
He made, you know, a remark.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Philip!  The senior partner?
<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
There might be some extras in the garage.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Put it out, man!
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Talk to me about what?
They appear to be authentic.
I'd like you to see this.
He had to come from somewhere.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
For what?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
I stood up first.
Agreed.
I would like to say goodbye.
The past?
I'm leaving in the morning.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
If it's good advice.
Why?  What's going on?
I don't know anymore.
Jennifer.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Why?
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
Why?
I know.
I can take care of myself.
I don't know.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.
You won't die if you let me help.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
Like what?
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
I gotta piss real bad.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Okay.
Use more ice.
We're trapped in a house.
I overheard him with the girl.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Mine, too.
Whatever.
Keep your head down.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
He didn't say.
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
What's my name?
What?
Not until the man calls.
We're okay.
He has lots of disks.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Cockroaches?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
I'll be over.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
How so.
What is it?
Promoted. House Manager.
That will take time.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
I will give you my house.
You could have asked for a favor.
Where are you hurt, son?
How can we help him.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
You cannot go alone.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
A Volkswagen!
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
Paul! Then another voice.
That is why they call it coach?
What! Paul storms off.
As the trucks go.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Thank you, Roger.
I don't know.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Left, goddamnit!
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
What?
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
There's always exceptions.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
-- listen to the man --
We're safe?
It's succeeding!
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
Run.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
You know everything you do gets me hot.
I know.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
And here's your goddamn severance!
I think it's something better experienced then described.
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
I never saw you --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
He must've beaten us all here!
Why not?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
What was her name?
No!
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
The place is pretty dusty.
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Ok...
What?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Why?
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
What?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
I'm trying to quit.
And he still sits there?
Would you know this store again?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
You're JP Monroe, right?
Uh-huh.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
I'm sorry.
Wow.  Thank you.
But how in God's name ...
Not quite.
JP?
Really?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Okay.
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Never, why do you ask?
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Too bad.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
The Shazzammeter!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
The couch, please.
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Every year?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Hey! Where's that martini?!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
Forty-eight years...
I thought you served misfits here!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
What the heck they doin'?
This you're familia' with.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yessir.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
I --
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Well... I'm for it...
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ya get the special?
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
That's nonsense, Alma.
Ti-Joseph?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
But, Mrs. Rand --
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
It's my day off.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
But she's not dead, Wes.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
And charming?
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
You want that?
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
What?
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
In the car.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Sure dad.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.
Birth control.
I just can't believe you could be so --
Huh?
You know, dah--
But what?
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
I insist.  Don't touch them.
It's really quite all right.
It's not like we're too busy.
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
What do you mean?
Shit. You're not planning --
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
How do you know this shit?
I dunno. I --
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Charles, what time is it?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
I had him!
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Don't worry about him...
Good.  He's up next.
How much closer would you say you were?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
We'll get the other one, though.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
That's right.
How do you mean?
You know what about.
No way.
What kind of stuff?
I told you I don't remember.
Thought you wanted something fun...
You don't know.
I was a mentor to her.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Your lips, they didn't move.
What are we?
I have not spoken to him...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
We want no quarrel with him.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Why does he call you that?
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
But if she dies...
Why should I be?
I want it!
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Sure...
You have fed. You were made for this...
Do you think so?
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
No...
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
Lestat, what do you mean?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
We haven't exchanged anything.
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Karla! You promised.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Okay, I won't.
What do we do?
Is he?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Will you try...for me, please?
Ben Willis.
To get out of Southport?
Right. Now I remember.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I guess so.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
How much?
Cool.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Well ——
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
But why?
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
I think not.
She has never mentioned her family.
What an odd question!
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
You have forgotten my last name?
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
Yes?
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Theodosia.
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Listen to what I say --
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Well, tell, him.
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Who is it?
Yes, but George . . .
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Hiya, George!
Hi, Bert.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Of course it's the place.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Hmmm . . .
You're not paid to be a canary.
Anything I can do back here?
Aw, get going!
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh, George.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
He's pretty young for that job.
How's that?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
She was here first.
Huh?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Well, I don't.
Okay –– what can we lose?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Ummmmm . . .
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
About what?
Didn't you tell her?
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
You forgot something.
With butter, if they got any....
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
The Shark.
Gangway, Turkies!
Want to talk about it?
You bet.  Hang on....
Can you get us a line?
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
You got it.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Hey -- you can't do that.
Got it.
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
The Shark's mouth.
We don't know that, do we?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Okay, so that's it.
It's an island.  Got to run.
Damn.
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Mike's out there.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Someone has to do something.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Help!  Help!
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
I'm going.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
You going with Patrick?
Coming about, then.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
So?  So?
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Yeah.  Down there.
Shit.
I guess.
How come?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
They just wanted to say hello.
I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
That we swim.
Make up your mind.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Are you coming...?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
I know I can capture it.
What's that?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Me, too.
Sure.  Let's go.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
What do you mean, we don't?
Michael, you're not going down there.
I can have them walk backwards.
That's preposterous!
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Not at all.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
I'm a water-skier.
I don't know, what else is there?
Come on, it's fun!
No, think of something else.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Polar bears in Georgia???
It's not closing, Mike.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Watch me, Grandma....
Yes, I did.
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
I don't know...You...I don't know.
What's wrong?  What happened?
Thea was attacked by a shark....
Henny Youngman....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Come on, I'll show you around.
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
I am.
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
No!
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
Yes I can....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
You got a better idea...?
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Still tagging conch?
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
Down here....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
How long?
I don't like it....
You don't like my voice...?
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Maybe?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Because I dislike her too much ..
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
You want me to stop the car?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Hey ..
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
No, Sir.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
And did they?
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
My hands?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
I know.
You do?
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Two or three years ago.
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Don't mix very well with beer.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Okay, this is working.
Listen to me, it's over.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Hi.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Oh good.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
So this break... is a break-up.
Of course I know --
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
I'm sorry, I --
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Huh?
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
No, I'm saying to be --
Forget it.  Forget it.
It's a risk.
Good deal, man.
How do I know?
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Fine.
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
To the pools?
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
-- and I'll get 'em.
Let's go the zoo.
I'm scared.  What is it?
What'd I say?
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
People change.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Just drop it Paul!
No, it's...
When did you have it last?
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
I would completely support that.
He loves you too.
About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
They never got that big.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
In Costa Rica?
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
You are an academic.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
I don't believe you.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
That Richard.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
What do you think they want?!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
I think she's with Sarah!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
The door security systems are shutting down.
The monitors are failing.
How am I supposed to transport them?
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
They're not here.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Hola, bienvenido
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
In a box under my seat.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
Why?
No.
I didn't say you were scared.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
John, John.
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
You want to put in chain saws?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
I want to look at the rest of the house.
Other guy?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
His camera... it's still recording.
Who's chest?
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Yeah, what is it?
Not yet.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Yes.
Will you do me a favor then?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
You're just doing your job.
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
One of you must be mistaken.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
You look tired.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
What's to become of us now?
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Two... maybe three.
The mountains?
Kong ...
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Sure dear, yes.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Guess!
Sorry. 
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
You think people hate you.
Yes indeed.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
I guess he figured it was better.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
What about everything since?
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Try some other ways. 
No, I said what did you think.
Yeah, you got to me.
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
It's not so bad.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
Town Police.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Nobody's seen that.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Not particularly.
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
Lunch in a restaurant.
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Soon.  Very soon.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
Uh huh...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Uh huh?
Good night.
See you in the morning light...
Is that really your chair?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Where will my toys be?
Who will read me my stories?
Overruled.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Do you have a lover now?
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
What?!?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Fine.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Yeah.
Got it.
I'm sure.
Slow down...Slow down...
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Uh, huh...
Yes, Holiness.
It is alright, Father.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
He is a capable man.
I miss him too.
Two.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
I accept it. What is suffering?
What do you think?
Tell me.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
True.
Is that true or pretend?
Pretend.
Ahh.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
You, kill me?
You are unharmed?
Hmm.
Oh, yes.
I need to see his habitat.
What the hell are you doing?!!
I'm laying a spring trap!
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
It came from across the lake.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
That hurt my feelings.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
Who?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I'd be able to see something.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You flew up here because your boss--
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Let's get away from the shore.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Obviously I was wrong!
I'll take it!
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
This is a little different.
Yes.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Look ten feet into the water.
Me too.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Wild guess.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
No.
Lecter said a lot of things.
Well, except for the one girl.
Get me out!
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Oh.
Jack Gordon.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Thanks.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Point taken.
But if he knew we have so little time -
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Not lately. But maybe someday.
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
It's much better than your shoes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Ahhh... Why?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
A cattle ranch?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
And - one morning I just - ran away...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Dr. Lecter -
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Our father? Did you see my father?
I have nothing to go back for.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Then what?
: Only one or two loads.
We'll see in the morning...
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Yes.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
I know that.
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Do it.
What was it?
I'm going to kill it!
Two hundred meters.
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
And Tom took care of them.
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Where did he get a hundred grand?
All right, furry muff.
Sure is.
All right, Kenny.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Out the back.
And the weed?
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
And look what happened to that.
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
Right as rain.
I'11 meet you in the car.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
For half a million?
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
Yes?
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
You've already been fifteen.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How the fuck should I know?
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
They're not going to jail.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
I do, sir.
And you and Private Graves--
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
That's not the point.
Yeah, well--
You were in a fight--
What?
So that's him--
If it's too late--
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
So they stayed in Florida?
I got a pretty good guess.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
He does.
Cliff--
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
You could take it--
You know who it was they dug up?
Masons been around a long while.
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Right.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Bandidos, Injuns--
Protection?
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
We have a murder?
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
He was killed.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
He squeezed money out of you?
Okay? He's not here?
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
And when my father was Sheriff?
Of course you can.
You gonna stay out here?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
So I've heard--
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They've got my Amado.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
So she tells me three times a week.
Yeah.
He hates me.
No--
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
Yeah?
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
And people better clear out of here! Now!
I haven't seen anybody come by.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Name's Otis.
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
You believe that?
Yeah.  It's French.
Nix.
You ever been married?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Knew what?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
I know him.  I saw him.
Death.
It's him... it's him.
What is he?
Maybe he'll show you.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I'm here, aren't I?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Yes.
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Go away.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
What's the difference?
Are you a believer, then?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
You want more money, is that it?
Shut up!
Yes.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
The Puritan?
For what?
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
And you believed him?
Not true.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
No, its easy.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Yeah? But look at you.
Oh, she'll love it.
Fuck off.
Well... have a good flight.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Yes?
Bob?
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
One moment, please.
Ok.
I got some hair stuff.
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
Do you think they have a room here?
It's probably trivial.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
I believe in you.
This is the person...you were talking about?
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Eight.  That okay?
You have to tell me who did it.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
What's his name?
I didn't know what else to do...
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Peter Kelson?
And also that...
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I do.
I'll bet.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
So what?
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
What?
Maybe that's my problem.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
He's looking right at me.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
What happened?
She told me she killed them.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Dad around?
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
She's alright.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
I don't wanna see that.
Why not?
Always on my ass, anyway.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
What?
I know.  But chances are...
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
So how's the job going?
Didn't have to try very hard.
Thanks.
What's up, Sidra.
For real?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I don't like flowers.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Kay.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
I don't.
He ain't Spalding.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
You had four offensive rebounds.
Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
I said fine.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Here I am.
It happens, right...
Who's nobody?
Nah.  I have curfew.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Least you got your priorities straight.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Thanks.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Getting there.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Something was just missing.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
For what?
Your hair looks so cute like that.
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Said he'd be home later.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
What?
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
Well can you connect me to someone else?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, but I don't know --
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
ok.
Yeah.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
-- do you wanna cup?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Yeah.
Okey-doke.
You wanna go on a date with me?
Billingsley's?
Why not?
You wanna make a deal with me?
Let's make a deal.
ok.
Yeah, of course.
I lost my gun.
What?
It's ok.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Yes I do.
Just say no.
please, what is it, please --
just let me walk out, ok?
Claudia.
Diet Coke.
I want a shot of tequila too.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
What?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident.  I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault.
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Where is he?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Yeah.
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Who?
No.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
I'm gonna start rolling --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
This isn't meant --
Yes.
the valley?
And "Frank?"
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
I don't think, he can't...
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
You're here.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
I'm sorry.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
I don't know what I've done.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're her boyfriend?
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
What's MOW?
I can't.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda --
Shut the fuck up.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Ok.
That's it.
Maybe.
You're late, not me.
I didn't know the answer --
Why did you do this?
It's ok.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
He is nothing now.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
I am with you!
A body.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Those can be adopted --
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
But -- what is Porthos doing?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
What you're asking is impossible!
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I heard your playing.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Athos, I beg you --
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Whose rooms are those?
Your Majesty has had many women --
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
At least help Raoul.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
He is my brother.
... The ball... Continue.
I am unhurt --
Thank you, Keeper.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
My dear, I've already done it.
No, you may wait behind the screen.
What do you need?
You mean shut your ass down!
Did you start out area six?
What?  Wait a minute -
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
You'll find out - soon enough.
Yeah.
Where the hell is my car?
No -
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
Both at the same bank...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Mind if I come along for the ride?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
Twenty minutes max.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
The mark? Yes.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
Tell me now.
Get me a plane...
No.
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
'Changes?'
What?
It's not over yet.
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
He had to.
He went to the men's room.
Let's get to the physical.
What's being photographed?
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
Uh-huh.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Francis? Where are you?
You'll come by?
No!
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Yes.
Oh, God.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
No.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
No. I can help you.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Most people are.
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Tell me about yourself.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Lt. Fisk said...
Yes. Who are you?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Yes.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
You had disadvantages.
You're very tan, Will.
Do you have the file with you
That's interesting.
I don't have one right now.
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
I hope you have a second chance...
Tank you veddy much.
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
What, you don't think I can beat him?
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
So who's gonna pay for it?
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
GET OFF!
Then your father's a wimp.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Why??  I... I attend every year.
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Yes.
Know what?
And you are?
It's Choi.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Midnight watch.
Shit!  Apoc?
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Who's coming for me?
How?!
Go!  Now!
Why not?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
I think I do.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
And you still believe I'm the One?
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
I need the main wet-wall.
Not too bright though.
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
From you.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
It's going into replication.
But an Oracle can.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
I'm going in after him.
Not yet.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What do they want?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
You're not far from Cypher.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Thanks.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Anybody wanna have a game?
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'Thou art then a king?'
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
Wouldn't bother me.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Do you have enough?
Here.
I don't mind.
It's all right.
Anything specific?
Did you?
Take your time.  I don't care.
I know...I know.
Count it.
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Well...no.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
You think so?
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I don't like cake.
'Goddam party'!
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yes.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
The dagger --?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
A voice?
As close as a deal could be.
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
As much as Joe's?
Please, Drew.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
My Doctor Lady?
Sure.
Yes?
What do you mean 'free'?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Come again?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
Yes, that's why I said it.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
No --
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Yes?
Of course.
I'm not everybody.
What's it like where I'm going?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
I don't know.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
That's okay.
What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
So that's what love is?
No.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Thank you.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
I am not a dream.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
I don't!
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm sorry --
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Sure.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Bravo.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Then what is it?
Joe?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
The fireworks are about to start.
Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
'Her'.
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
No, it was so right it scares me.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt.
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
So you're holding my calls?
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
Yeah?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
It's isolated.
So I just take your word?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Who did he go to meet?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Thanks.
Sweet.
What are you here for?
Did Teddy send you?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Things change.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Why not?
Are you sure?
Yes, I will.
You can't just take it!
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
Good.
What do you think?
It's a rip and a hit.
I got to talk to my ADO...
I got the item.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
She's dead...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Zero risk.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Maybe I'm only one.
Do I need it?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Something's wrong.
On my way back...
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
On the phone.
White supremacist types.
He did volunteer one time...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Alonzo...
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Yeah, oh yeah.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Same all around! For my friend, too!
For money.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
You like it? Take a look.
Yeah, well, so?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I'm wet.
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
What you got me up here for?
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
How's your hernia?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Aslan, there... 
Seven years...
Yeah.
Cut his fucking throat.
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
That's a great philosophy.
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Across both tracks!!
Don't get kinky here...
Toss the flare down!
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
What is it?
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Sounds good.
You want to read it?
If you wouldn't mind.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
It's fine.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I can live with "great."
I'm getting to believe you.
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Show me the way?
You want me to burn my book?
I don't know.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
--not fair?
--cliff-hangers--
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
To Misery.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Be my guest.
I'm glad you like it.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
That's nice.
He's your client, huh?
You think he might be missing?
I'm sure you're right.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
From her point of view or mine?
How I usually find you, Nyah.
What else?
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
What are you talking about?
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
What can we do' mate?
Uh-huh?
Do what?
Indeed.
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for everything.
Which is?
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Then feel better!..
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.
Twice.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..not in time to save him.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Yes.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Oh yeah?
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I'm going to answer it.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Ethan?
Claire.
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
No sir.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
Mm - Hmmm...
Very good.
What was your deal with Job?
I wouldn't dream of it.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
You got it.
Of course I can hear you.
I don't know.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Try it again.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
Thank you, Rose.
I'm going to bed now.
He got hit by a bus.
He did?
What are you doing here?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Yes.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Because I have no Luck!
Where are you taking me?
It makes you look like an angel.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
I'm telling you you can't.
What are you talking about?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Come on.
How can you ask me that?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
You're late!
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
No. I'm gonna wait.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Johnny.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
What?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
How near is she to death?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
She recovered.
It was a miracle.
What sins have you to confess?
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
I don't know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
I came right from the airport.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
No idea.
Of course I want to.
Definitely!
I am alone in the world.
Then why are you eating alone?
Why do men chase women?
I'm a little cold.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Yes!
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
King of the WHO?
You said it again!
'Tis but a scratch.
Come on you pansy!
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Behind the rabbit?
... You silly sod.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What is your name?
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Why?
I can understand that.
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Father, lad.
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
How?
Got it?
Yes?
And make sure he doesn't leave.
What is your name, handsome knight?
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
We must examine you.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
The good-looking one.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Are you all right, Barney?
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mama...
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
There are important papers from --
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
I am a blank sheet.
If you hunt, you kill.
Quite.
It's nothing.
Aye.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
I am.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
He thought so, yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
I beg your pardon?
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
We'll see which way the wind blows.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Of course, at once.
Why not?
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
Sure.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, ARCADE.
You don't like it?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
It's twelve-thirty!
Funny.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
No way.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
I don't know.
And beat it at it's own game.
No I'm not...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
There...
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
I know.
So tell me you're okay, then.
And then keep on driving?
Hold my keys, then.
Then we'll go home.
Is that your question?
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
Yes...but...how did you...
Not yet, honey...
Cynthia...what's going on?
It's been a very strange day.
You gotta be kidding?
Will you meet with him?
There is no problem.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
No. I can't.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
How do you remember how to talk?
We'll take our check.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Keep going. Go around to the back.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Where at?
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Sure.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
No one has a gun to your head.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Not listening !
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
Okay.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
That's a shame.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
Got it.
No.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Good, sir.
Better, sir.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
Thank you.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Which one, this door is locked !
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
I don't even know your name.
What about giving the other guy a break.
What do you remember about her.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Thanks, I needed that.
I will. How's Shelly?
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
I told you it was a long story.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Give it back Nicholas!
You're so clever.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
What difference does it make?
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Just come and get it...right here!
...I dropped it.
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
An adventure?

For the mini-bike fund.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Committed.
This is it I guess.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
She'll be all right baby.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Sort of?
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Oh no.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
What do you mean?
He is?
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
You're such a baby.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Okay.
Kinda like men.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Want to what?
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Pointing upwards Look...
Perfect.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
I love this guy! 
No, sweetie, not yet.
Feeding my fish.
There were just too many of 'em.
What was my mama like?
Really?
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
No, no no....
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
This is one big house for one single person.
Come here, sit down over here.
Oh, Vada...
Get away from me!
Do you think she is?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Come here, sit down.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Oh great!!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I can't, I have to go home.
It's a mosquito bite.
Heaven.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Bed wetter!
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Stand back.
What do you want it for anyway?
He likes her better than me.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Well, let's spit on it.
For what?
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
Desperate.  To talk.
When I'm talking to children.
You've been working on this, huh?
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Someday she'll thank you.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
And what will he do?
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Hello.
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Nobody has.  So far.
You've met her parents.
... Thomas, yeh.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Have you.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
This is where I proposed.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
An so it is.
Right here.
I know that, Star.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
No.
No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
What's wrong honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Your job, huh.
He's going to run for president.
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Minimum.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Sure thing.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Not yet.
What is a turkey shoot.
Hi, Sherry.
How'd you get in here.
I'm not really a musician.
He is just wonderful.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
What year?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Bet the sheets are grey.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
About three years.
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Wrong.
I know.
What?
I see.
What!
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Southern California.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
You think it will?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Don't stop!
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Not good.
I'm keen with anticipation.
Do you miss Mallory?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
On average forty million.
And they made the first move?
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Jesus...
And where do you keep Mickey?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Out.
That's right.
You a union man?
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Oh yeah?
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
You work around town?
Your folks live there?
You got a problem all right.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Good night, Duff.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
What?
I'll have some coffee, please.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
He could live with us.
Come here, baby.
Go on - hit me!
Don't look so scared.
We'll be all right.
About ten dollars.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
What d'you mean?
How 'bout the key?
What 'you signifyin'?
Yeah, see you in hell.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Just tryin' to be helpful.
She'll do.
What did you say, boy?!
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
How 'you gonna live?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
I know.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Don't play with me.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Dixie McCoy
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Can you walk?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Jah guides us.
Never heard of him.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Can you take me to it?
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Where did you here that?
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Exactly.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Nope.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Yeah.
Anita!
Okay. That's bad.
Very romantic.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Anita!
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
By Guy?
Eh.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Hey--I can be out of control.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
My sword.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Is that true?
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
I know.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Lock.
We can handle it.
No!
Taste it.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
What are you doing here?
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
How come?
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
Make a left at this corner.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
You're going out?
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm serious.
I'm sure you would.
I had such an awful dream.
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
No, she's right.
To old friends.
I -- I think so!
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
Sure.
Let's try this way.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
I don't do that shit.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
That's right.
Then maybe you're ready.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
C'mon.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fine.
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Coffee?
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
You abide by rules like that?
Nothing.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
No, you were brilliant
This is the place.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Stay forever.
You do?
Okay.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Yup.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes -- sort of...
Shame!
Working with Leonardo.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Any bit in particular?
That's right -- Topol.
Not classic, no.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
I believe I have.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
What are the choices?
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Right.
So?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Mister Sefelt?
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
I wanna report a robbery!
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Wow! They're so quiet.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Sure, Mack...
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Me too...
Lemme see...
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
With your own two hands?
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
I'm busting outta this place.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Sure, Mack...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
I'm hungry.
That's correct, Doc ...
Good. Good.
Shhh!
Are you a doctor?
You're breathin' right now.
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Oh, yeah?
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
What?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
Si.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What for?
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Does he love you?
I know the feeling.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
GET OUT!!
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Just since yesterday.
Tonight?
Well, not exactly...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Yes?
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
He's a podiatrist or something.
But it's July.
I have vacation time coming to me.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
Only what?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
What's that supposed to mean?...
Nothing.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Is he looking at us?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
What about Larry?
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Oh.
Huh?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
Ten billion to one.
Why should he forget it?
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
Then don't.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Mm—hmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I'm with Terry.
I can get home all right from here—
Do you like pigeons?
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
How do you like that one?
How do you like it?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
You haven't finished your beer.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I don't rate it.
Go ahead, wear it.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Thanks just the same.
Every one of 'em... .
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
He wanted to see me again.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
This is my business.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
D 'n D?
Nice fellows.
But you still hold out for silence?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Boy, you must've been up early.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Easy. Easy, boy.
Hey look-
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
My favorite little cousin.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
Not that free.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Those creatures..!
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Be careful!
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
As you wish, Master
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Glenn Michaels.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Who are you?
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
I saw Karen Sisco.
I get that feeling, yeah.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, why?
Why you think is today?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
I'll need a last known address.
Another C.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
So you've done this before, huh?
You're right.  So why take a chance--
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Is that right?
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
I can go to the bar.
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
Well, does it make sense to you?
That's not what you were about to say.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Okay.  How many going out?
I hear six.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
You goin' right back to work?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Why's that?
What-- when?
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Oh...
You're not my type.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
Your dog was killed?
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
He's still married though, huh?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I imagine you would've though.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
It's possible.  Why?
That's right, just me.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Foley's got it.
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Power dive!
Home of the brave!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Then why are you looking for her?
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
...He said that?
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
Then wh-where do we land?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
We can explain, Colonel.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
I was hoping to meet him.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Charlie! Am I dead?
I call this the staccato. 
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Is this slow enough for you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
That's real big of you.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
I'm trying.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
What, why?
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
Is that one of your poems?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I hate chickens.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
You think so?
That would be impossible.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Doing some shopping?
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Quiet today?
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
He'll win.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
For what?
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
What's that?
What's inside?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
There's one way to find out.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Wbat're you talking about?
When do we start?
Come on. You can't be serious.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
The old Indian burial ground.
Yeah...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Bob...
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
You're not smiling.
One hour!
Fuck you.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Kids are great.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Continue.
Your... lover?
As in, the vegetable?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Fine.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
It's me, you dork.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Opera?
What impressed you about him?
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
No. I didn't.
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
Do you take risks?
Gay movies.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Answer the question, please.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Right.
Get real.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Second.
Yeah... ?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Helloooo...
<u>What</u>?
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Look deeper.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
But I just wanted to say --
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Just give me your hand.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
I know what's in here!
How many bottles?
Can we switch?
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Like my pistola.
Well, don't ask me to.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
Never said you were a hype, either.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
Some prophet guy?
For now.
Riddick?
I would rather we all stay--
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Well, what's it look like now?
What if you're one of five?
So which one caught your eye?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
You still don't believe me, do you?
What are you doing there?
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
It's probably wrong --
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Zira....
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Show this to the President.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Let's take a look.
Try telling them our names.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Then you admit --
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
What is this?
Why not?
Do you believe him?
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
Yeah, what is it?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Shaddup bitch.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Thank you.
Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
If I change my mind.
How do you do?
Immigration Officer?
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
Possibly, Miss.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
Sure... but somebody always does..
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
Bad enough.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Why?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
Killaine's wise to what?
Wonder what?
If you're doing all this just for me.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Would I want to?
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
Right, Miss.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
I can't answer that.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
This way.
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
You mentioned information.
Got the information on you?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
How's life treating you?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
We do, when we get the chance.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Well--good night.
I never notice the view after the first week.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Information.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Lay off, can't you?
A little something on account perhaps?
I don't think you locked your door.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Would you?
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Not if it clears the air.
Now, you're being beastly.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
I don't know, sir.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Not too far, I hope.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
I think you'll do very well.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
Of course.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Thank you.
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
How nice.
You just might.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Let me see.
Mmm...
Far too long.
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Are you up to something?
Okay, I will.
They don't count.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
No.
U-huh.
Darling Susan.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
SHIT!!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Not so far.
Babes.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Thanks, buddy.
Okay, Dad.
Did he rob it?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
It's been a long time, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
I think it's Hawkins.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
Who indeed...
You've got a lot of nerve.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sit... and spin.
No.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
For an hour.
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
Edward... you got it!
Exactly.
Always.
Why?
Yes...
No?  Why's that?
No shit.  They expensive?
I sell them.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Where'd you learn to do this?
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
I have work to do.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
He's good at what he does.
Huh?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
Business.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
It was good.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
I know a lot of nice girls.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We're letting them slide?
Do it.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
He's not gonna want us.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
In Beverly Hills?
Professionally?
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
I was in here yesterday.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
What? -- go on --
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Gently!!
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
The body?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
I hope we win...
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
You want me to read this or not?
I don't understand.
There we cannot help you.
-- anything you want --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
I am not left-handed either.
Okay.
That would be inconceivable.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Yes.
Good. Then pour the wine.
You've made your decision then7
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
Yes, it's quite possible.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
What???
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
With whom?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
We swear it!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Always.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Of Siegfried...
Of Siegfried...
Bismark...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Groovy!
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Someone is sitting in that window.
Of course not.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
Casharoonie!
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
With the forty thousand dollars?
Just what he told your detective.
Here?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What thing could we be in together?
Yes.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
You've led a charmed life.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Just wait here?
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Yes.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
What?
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
For what?
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Los Angeles.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
I have?
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
Is your time so empty?
Only my share.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
That's it. 
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Please.
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
He's already been.
At this hour?
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
I don't know what you've been saying.
Shut up!
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
I don't know--I can't tell--
Maybe you're right.
You found Buckley?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Yes, the child ...
No?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
I won't let you say that!
Well, I do say it.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Meaning what?
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No kiddin'.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
That's the one.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Here's a wow.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
How much money have you got?
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
You're insane.
Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done. 
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Okay.
A place you've never been.
What?
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Don't mention it.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Yeah.
You won't die, Rose.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
I don't know.
Well, it's not very plain.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Yeah.
Boy! Wow!
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
Here comes Daddy.
Is her husband sick or something?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Is anything wrong?
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Strange voices, Rose?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Oh, yeah?
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
I see. Outside it.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Move it!
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Dean Martin.
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
Follow me.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Speak for yourself.
No.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Murderer?  Really?
It's our job.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Slow down.
Let's hope.
No you're not.
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
Beholden to none.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Yeah.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
But I had to help my friends.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
As you wish.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
All set.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Leia!
Ahhh...
Here's the terminal.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
But, why must you confront him?
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Yes.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
It's alright Janet.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Want to come again and stay
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...I don't know.
I think it's closed.
Do you have a phone?
You sure?
It's fine.
Don't tease me.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Get that doctor.
One more round.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Does that bum have to say that?
Kiss my ass.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Charge it.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What about for food an' stuff?
...Fine.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
A few bucks.
Gonna try.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
No -- Just me.
Hey --
I like yella teeth.
I won't.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
...Tomato?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Here's the card?
When was they here?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
How do you mean?
I got pain an' experience too.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Bullmastiff.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
What kinda business?
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
It don't matter.
It don't bother me none.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
Whatta these guys want?
You serve martinis, doncha?
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
A joker to the end.
He made me laugh.
So what do you want me to do?
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Maybe.  Why?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Uh? Uh?
A challenge, on my life.
Romeo will answer it?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
By my head here come the Capulets.
Is the day so young?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Of love?
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Hold Daughter!
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Right.
Here's goodly gear!
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Is she a Capulet?
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
And I don't believe you...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
From Interpol?
You lose them!
Not yet...
You were a soldier, were you?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
We'll double your price.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
A post office box.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
And you respect him.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Soon.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I wanted to see who you were.
Who am I?
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
Gregor's cell phone...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Very ugly.
Business keeps you on the road?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
Why didn't you kill him?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
The Russian would be easier.
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
I want to get some hounds down here.
Sure thing, and --
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Never heard of it.
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Why?  Are you kidding me?
We don't know that.
Well someone's gonna find them.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Because...I know.
All right we will.
What are you thinking?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
No we're not.
He killed her...he killed her...
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
By Friday.
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
What for?
He's not, he's...
How the hell did he find it?
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
Could it have been this?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Sure.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Give me the bad news.
Not in the trunk.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
No, sir.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
Lee, you okay?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
No.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
You're not very good at this, are you?
What?
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Excuse me?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Take it!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
No.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Follow me my Asian brother.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
No you didn't!
What?!?!
It's worth it to me.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Just trying to make it look real.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Don't.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Right....
The license!  You get it?!
Don't go there...
Yeah, it's good.
Excuse me?
This concrete?  This is still America.
The art.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
No...what?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
They put you in charge?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Carter, shut up!
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Or somethin'.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
I want to speak with my daughter!
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
I was trying to find the right time.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
God bless you, Maggie.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
It's hurting.
His hair... any color.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Oh, please!
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
You afraid to try?
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
Yes, I did.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
She's the boss.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Why?
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Not eight...
No, I'm just going to head home.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Okay, okay.
-- it was a betrayal.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
Can too.
What?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
I want my money.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Yes.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Mom!
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
No.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
You want me to talk to him?
It is not --
You'll like it.
You think so?
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
It plays in 50 states.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Sure.  Looking good.
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Will she scratch up your back?
Whose show was this on?
What was?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
It's a sign.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
I was thirsty.
Was Mom an adjustment?
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Victoria? She's okay.
Who is Annie?
Are you going with her?
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about camping?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
You look good yourself.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
You haven't tried locking them up!
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Never... never... never!
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
Backward.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Sun up.
Alone?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Like what?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Well, if that's possible ...
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
The what!
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You've got to help around the house!
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Yeah.
How about in the house?
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
What happened to your eye?
Nothing.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
What are you hiding, Danny?
They would have killed you too.
Twelve
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
Not tonight.
I think on account of his nose.
Yes, Jimmy
You aren't coming with me.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, dickhead.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
What?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Answer the fucking question!
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Maybe he isn't showing.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Resistance?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
You must be a hell a shot.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
The hell he didn't.
Like hell, you did.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Wade?
To each, his own.
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
Senator's son?
No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Some.
The men said, nine.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
How about you shut up and take your position?
Let's just find someplace.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sure, what do you want to know?
You have orders, too.
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
HERE THEY COME!
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Get lost.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
I hope you understand.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Hang in there, man.
Yes.
I admit nothing.
So, what's your point?
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
You like it?
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
I'm fine.
Bon voyage.
Just finishing up in here.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
You think you know what this money is?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
This is me telling you about me.
Alright.
Yeah.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Yeah
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Bye.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
I don't think so.
Yeah, uh-huh.
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Hey.
Alright.  Key?
I was just going to kind of move around.
I love you man.
Yeah, alright.
He is.
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Oskar, please -
It's a beautiful city.
It's up to you.
These people, my people, I want my people.
You asked for shoe polish.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Wine?
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
The war could end.
Oskar -
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
I think it's too late.
Yes.
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
What now?
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
thought he was doing AA.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
I heard a noise.
That's too bad.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
It’s over, Cotton.
Where is Sidney's father?
Enter Cotton Weary.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
She dumped me.
The forbidden subject.
No. This is a set up.
You’re not going to get away with this.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
What guy?
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I know that.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
What are we looking for?
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
That's not the way we play the game.
You're getting obvious.
My morn was a Delta.
Yes, goddammit!
I don’t know.
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
Yeah, right.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The young girl is slashed again.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Shush.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Do you work for her now?
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Really? You're such a talented actor.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
And who would that be?
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Excuse me?
What Rielly?
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Off the record.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
None.
No really?
Good twist.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
I know!
GALE WATCHOUT!
Who's this?
I'm hanging up right now.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Yes, sir.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
Hey, hey, it's just me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
What number is this?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
They'd never make it in time.
Or else what?
Sure...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm getting scared.
No...
...please...
Please..stop...
Afraid not.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Answer the question and I will.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
No, not yet.
Mind if I join you?
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Yes, you doofus.
He's her boyfriend.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Casey? Casey?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Who are you?
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
You coming tonight?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
You'll never get away with this.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They think it's school-related?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'm not worried.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Yeah.
Really?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
You know that's not true.
Spit it out.
Murderers?
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
How's that?
I read.  Remember reading?
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
Bear with me.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
And?
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
What happened?
We have probable cause now.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Give me a break.
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
What?
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I want to have children.  It's just...
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
You got it with you?
And maybe you lie...
If they're still alive...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
That don't make 'em kin...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Look?
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Nine...  Ten!
Not no more.
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Comancheros...
I got your boy killed.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
Do you have a better idea?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
But what is the truth?
What?
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
And the title of this piece?
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
What is the chief part?
The title?
Put his feet in.
A share of the profits.
Oh, that.
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
As soon as I have found my muse
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Who wrote that?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
The show must … you know
I have. And chinks to show for it.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Is the day so young?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
As a nurse.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
Stand up straight, girl.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
Oh, but they can!
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
I have lost my gift.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
But the plague
Oh--I am him too!
Even your play.
I must. I must
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
I will do my duty, my lord.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
She sings too?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
A man, my lord?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
No.
Now.
You're not eating.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
About the mail --
I don't know.
Don't know what?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Parked outside?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
That's not him.
Then let's spend some money.
No, no, it's different.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Alex.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Don't you ever stop?
Burglary?
Downstairs.
There are only two other people in the flat.
No, three. Who said there were four?
Someone lost the key.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds.
What?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Sorry?
But they sneer, don't they?
Would you like to see the rest?
What's it about?
No.
That sounds fine.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
It turned out to be cancer.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Nummers.
What about?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
... what?...
God, I adore you.
No thanks.
No thanks.
I asked you first.
Don't make conversation with me.
They are?
Oh fuck, Norman!
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You are today.
I don't know. Probably not.
He's a very private person, actually.
You going to tell him?
No, thanks.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
And?
Yeah?
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down!
You don't do that anymore, do you?
He still having parties?
Why?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
I don't know... Jackie?
Don't go, Jackie...
Otis is dead.
-- please, please forgive me...
Hey, stop by the shop.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
Of course I like children.
Okay, baby. Okay...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Hello.
Egypt!
Great... can we talk later?
George.
About what?
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
I'll call you.
Bullshit.
Oh, Christ.
Yes.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
-- please, baby --
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
What did you say?
But Mr. Norman said --
Oh yeah.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I know it, I know it.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Have a drink.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
I mean, how did that happen?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
I'm finished with her.

And?
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Fine.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
See you later.
So what's your point?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Don't be silly.
I thought you said things were great with George.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Yesss?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
He's a hairdresser.
Not with your hairdresser.
Jill.
Three weeks.
No.
No.
No.
What was the Donner party?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Yes, Dad.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Room 237?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
All right.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
I won't, Mom.
Because he hides.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Who?
A nigger.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Thank you for saying so.
What time is it?
Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I can't really remember.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Oh...
How're you getting on?
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Jane-
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Well... was it a prescription?
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
I told you!
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
But Uncle Al! You said-
We won't!
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Perhaps.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yes, Mary?
Were you tempted?
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
You can handle this.
Today was the deadline, Vince.
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
You bastard!
Yes, Betty?
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
You know that song?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She won't?  Why not?
You watch yourself!
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Would you like that?
No food?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Mary Clarence!
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
You're my Olympic event.
The majority has spoken.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
He didn't do you a favor.
Get a stenographer.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
That should have tipped us.
Really...
However, we can also pray for other things.
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
She wasn't a nun?
A Benedictine.
Yes?
Many have.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Bring Young Masbath here.
What of it?
Your superiors are two days away!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
They need guidance.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
No, I couldn't...
I have others.  All I need is this.
Stay back.
Why this tree?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
People have put their trust in you.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
Must I hear this?
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I apologize if I worried you.
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
What would you have me believe?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Where?
Very little.  I must be going...
What... ?
I didn't see none.
Turn around.  Now!
In a way, yes.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
That boy wants me to.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Yeah.
What you got in there, warshing?
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
Please Doyle, don't.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Don't tell me what to do.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
I thought I told you to keep out!
I aim to kill you with it.
Childers.
I did live there in the state hospital.
They let you out?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Well, I hate him.
All right then.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Oh, jackin' off?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
Yeah.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
I reckon.
No sir.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Right now?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
All right then.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Ma'am?
What's that you say?
Do you have family here?
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
I reckon not.
I've heard it said that way.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Oh. How about before that?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Can I help you, sir?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Karl is a guy guy?
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
No thank you.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
It's yours?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Uh, better make it one.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
She probably died.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
I almost got married once.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And these?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
It was just a thought.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
I don't have much time. 
And?
So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
The inspiration.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
That's obvious.
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
It is.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Oh, yes.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
Yes.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Yes, he was.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
And what do you believe?
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
No spare.
And her farmhouse...?
I can't speak for him.
That's all he said.
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Wanna see my driver's license?
It's private.  Go away.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Shave our legs, stupid.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Done what?
Now you tore the other one.
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
What happened?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What do you think you're doing?
Yeah - lets shove off.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I'll say.
Honey - she called me honey.
What did you say?
I'm just going to get some ice.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
I met one of them.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
You like it?
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Oh - here and there - and around.
What's the big idea?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
You must be quite a girl.
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Pleased to meet you.
Come one!
Why not?
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
And I can never have children.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
It's three weeks in Florida -
Yes, Joe.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
William Morris!
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I'll say.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
You are?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
What makes you so sure?
Just my feminine intuition.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Why?
You don't say!
Shells?  Whatever for?
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
They shrink when they're marinated.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
What thing?
You mean - like frigid?
Have you tried?
Complete washout.
You poor, poor boy.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
What else is there for me? 
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
What is it?
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
I never join nothin'.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Why?
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
Thanks, Charlie.
What? Why? What do you mean?
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Mom, please.
Fair enough, but I’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...
You Yanks and your therapy. It’s great.  It’s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
I slept with your sister.
Kat.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
What is?
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
What do you think?
Okay.
I disappear. It’s not about me.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we’ll go back to the real world and...and you’ll be hiring me for your best friend!
Hi.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Hi, kiddo.
“...but it’s getting there. “
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
Sometime, but not like this.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Uh huh...
What's his name?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Here, put my jacket over you.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Come here, son...
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
Thank you, Daddy...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
Yes mam...
Children, come here...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's the heat.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
I wanta get some things.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
You ready to eat?
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
Will they give him a trial?
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Okay.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Okay.    Not.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Help yourself prickfuck!
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Oh yeah.
Hey, Chef.
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
Guess.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
What's the difference?
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Oh.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
You don't care.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Hi Stan.
My friend the clitoris told me.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
You didn't?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
I'm sure I will.
Very professional of you.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
My...wings...
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
That's right.
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
Why?  Where are you going?
What?  What are you talking about?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
Marry you?
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Thank you.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
Nope.
He's my dad.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
It's splitsville for you.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
No kiddin'.
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Putt-putt golf?
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
You got a better offer?
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
You're a scumbag.
I never saw you.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
You shouldn't touch her.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did you do to Buzz?
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Junior.
Junior who?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Look who's talking!
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Yippy!
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
The Peter Pan.
Whips...orange whips.
I'm not here to - I can't...
What do you want with my dad?
No, not at all.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Why were you suspended?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Nothing.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
So why do you stay?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
...lane six. Yes.
I'll be at the bridge.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
Suck my dick!
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
I can't see...
But she's --
He's right beneath us.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Everything can be killed.
I think I do.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
The what?
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Yeah, it was awful.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
Squids?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Valdomet.
A synthetic opium analogue.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
Not believing you.
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
How's Harry?
You think I'd really drink that?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Get away from the door, Beth.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Get away from me!
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
What?
No.  I didn't say that.
Then explain it to me.
You don't remember that?
What happened to her?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
You didn't say that about the food?
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Help me lift her.
Gimme a second --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Is it?
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
"We are friends".
The ships?
Told me what?
You've heard of me?
What report?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Like what?
I don't see anything.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
They never used to send a Navy car.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
I'm not afraid of anything...
You could put it that way.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
They use the Bogan Force.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
It's automatic.
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
I think I did.
Come back here... Where are you going?
We'll send a squad up.
With four casualties?!
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
It's what I deserve.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
We're the old men, Ace.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
You and me, huh ?
So ?
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Your turn...
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
You're right. Let's never stop...
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Too bad for her if she's not around.
How come we never got together ?
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Hi, mom.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
What is your position ?
Uh, I don't know.
What's going on, Diz ?
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
You are what...?
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
It's taken control of the computer...!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Sit down, please.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
What answers?
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
Sure plan to.
Go you Huskies?
I have one, but they lost it.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
No, no, I see...
Yes...
As the Old Mill goes around...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
Uh huh.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
What are you doing down there?
One moment.
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You believe that?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
<u>Please</u>...
...yes.
I told them what you said about the script...
...what...?
Yes...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
What are they offering?
I wasn't doing business.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Who is this person that you've found?
And I need a drink.
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
What'll I do for fun?
Isn't he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
Bourbon and Milk.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
I've always seen that.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
It's night.
But we...
Claire, Bob Bar...
You can't do what?
I know that...
Who are these from?
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...wants a piece...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
He didn't have to tell...
You should.
A witness to what...?
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I can write it.  I can't type it.
No.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
That's what I said.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
...the city council...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
That will never happen.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
I'll be there for you.
Like a big sister.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
Great.
This is a joke, right?
Mom?  What's wrong?
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Let me be the judge of that.
I'll miss you so much.
Here.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
See, I...
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
And many meatballs.
Is that like Luigi's?
Pray.  We never find out.
You have the WORST flu since...
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
And when did that pass?
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
And I'm supposed to care.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
To make it easier for them or you?
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
A lot smaller.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I need practice.
I did it for her.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
She was angry at herself.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
How's she doing with Brad?
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Uh.  You hate my guts?
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
I have their past.
We have to talk.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
What if he is?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
What?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Four brothers and five sisters.
This is work.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
He's dead.
Poison gas.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Yes, I do. I love them!
We're not ready!
I dunno.
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
The same.
One in a million recover.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Well, now you have.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
Any books you like to read for fun?
I dunno...
So what's going on?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Anything I might know about?
That's too bad.
Three.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
Is it loaded?
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
No, thanks.
Whoopee.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Well Cooper...
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
I'll let the senator tell you.
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Drop the anchor!
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
There's enough in one vial...
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Give that back to me.
See!  See, I told you.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
That's government property, Major.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
A shooting war!
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Plan-R????
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I guess so.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
I presume the planes are armed?
How many planes did we lose?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
What?
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Hang on, boys.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Yeah?
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
What happened?
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Yeah!
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Typical male.
What's it about?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Right now?
Yes!
A long, long, long...
No. Life is too short.
Yeah.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Hey, man.
What?
Bullshit.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Great.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
I can come visit?
Please!
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, you were there?
Please.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Come on. Inside.
You rich?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Really?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Erica.
It's a mistake to think that.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
I'd love to read that.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Because I'm alienated.
Who were you talking to?
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
What?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Wow. You did that for me?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
No.
Come on!
Seven-twenty.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Yes.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm talking about idealism.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
And?
Come with me.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Just go.
No, it's not...
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
What?
What?
Burnfield. No place like it.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
What are you saying?
No, this has everything to do with you.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
You do not!
Yeah.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
I'm moving.
That's because I am.
Me?
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Don't do that, man, okay?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Positive.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Oh... What are you working on?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
You damn well better...
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
Action! The scene starts.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
How about the Rainbow Room?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
Why should you do that?
Nobody can be that busy.
So do I.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Get out.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
December twenty-first.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Just a scene I cut out.
They've come for my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
You think this is all very funny.
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
"Mad about the boy."
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Where are my cigarettes?
Where are your...?
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
Yes, Norma.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Wipe your feet!
You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out.  Gillis     I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.  A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   Come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
That's what I told them.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Uh-huh?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
What?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Frankly, no.
Thank you, Max.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Whatever you say.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
We can't do that.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Let me kiss you.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
What?
Well thanks a pile, fella.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I bet they do.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Theories?
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
You bet your ass.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
I allowed it to escape the City.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
This is all your clothes?
You sure?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
What? Me?
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Throw him out.
You're wasting your breath.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
I seem to be.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
We get together sometimes.
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Who gets it, the company?
I'm tryin' to.
What are you talking about, fella?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
We've already got some.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
No...I just have a little stop to make.
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Thank ...you.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
But the other night...
Diet soda?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Where's the handle?
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
It could make weather!
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
Hostages?
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
You're not selfish at all.
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
North!
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
Genius!  --  Lex.
I'll be alright.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Sensible enough.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
He has powers as we do . . .
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
What more?
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Clark . . . wait!
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Our other dinner guest.
Get the box, nephew.
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Destiny.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
North. It's north
Not really, no.
Unbelievable.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Big night coming up?
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Of this...Superman.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Super...man. Hmmm...
You're not the only one.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
Lara, please...
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Right on the first guess.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Uh-huh.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
It is for me.
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
Of time, Luthor.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
And what does he do again?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Sure.
I have to.
Well I don't.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
From what?
Berries.
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
That's right.
That would complicate things.
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
I'll...take it straight.
Why?
Will you be spending more than a night?
People who will help our cause.
What do they do?
Crafts.
Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Yes.
What is it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Please.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
Really?
Of course.
Very slick.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
No.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
Okay.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Hitler!
But of course...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
See my mother?
Hurry back.
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
No...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Are you finished?
He means that much to you...?
- He's got them on him.
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
That's no way to talk...
It is a favor, isn't it?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Yes, but why?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
What ship?
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Why did you call me?
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
What chip?
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
You sure?
Max.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Why?
You will.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Trust me.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
Relax now, Sarah --
Our duty is to help Furtwängler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
Eating is eating... and...
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
I guess it's possible.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
With more what? More what?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
I have a duty.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
No. Ours was damaged.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
I can't do this. It's not right.
I would like to go now, please.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
Who warned you?
No!
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Show you?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
What?
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
Never heard of him, who is he?
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Can you handle it?
Just what you see, pal.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Great.

What's it to ya?
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
About what?
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Of course.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
I can't sleep.
Send a unit.
Call her.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
I don't think he's breathing.
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
If there was one.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I think not.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Can we talk?
Not here!  They can see.
What are you talking about... ?
I don't know.  A lot.
Get us out!
You call them...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Stop talking...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Julliard, yeah.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
Why?
Will you?
Who?
Slow down, take a breath...
Do you know how to change a tire?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Stop it!
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
I know.
No, thank you.
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Why are you following me?
Uh... Nell Vance...
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Yeah.
Sure.
It's a question.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
I, I just can't...
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
I got more scared.
Sure.
What?
How'd I know it was for you?
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I think so.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Then what good is he?
I'm a gracious host.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Not bad.
Okay.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
What kind?
Our black friends?
We'll find him.
Fuck you.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Faith.
He's gotta know why.
Do you have any friends, man?
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Uh-huh.
Probably.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
What was that, then?
It was the bars, then.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Your employer?
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
I'll bloody well ask him.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
I can see the attraction.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Overnight.  What about just now?
I don't believe it.
What about your grandmother?
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Yeah?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Which kind?
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Walked.
Ann--
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
No. Uh... family friend.
Uh-huh.
Ah.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
That'll be fine.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
She's a rare one.
All right, I guess.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
How much to they want, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Oh, don't be a grump.
You don't have to tell me anything.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
So... who... who actually--
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Huh?
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
What'd he say?
We're just closing, friend.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Where the hell are you?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Mind if I have a look?
You're kidding.
I believed them.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
You're right.
They're eggs.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Footsteps!
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
So what?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
I don't understand.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
What happened?
You were behind me?  Running after me?
Gone.
Oh God!  Help!
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
I have to shoot.
One.
<i>A month.</i>
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
So when are you leaving?
Nursery?
You think so?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
No.
Really?
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
What's that?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I won't be here Sunday.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Truman, stop it!
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
I'd ask for identification.
We don't even know you.
When was that?
Yes.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
Negotiating with whom?
You can't.
What?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
I'm on the roof.
No. I haven't.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
It's locked?
Something sweet.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I'd been told as much.
What did you find?
And you've never seen anything like that?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
Yeah, well they may this one.
I have no idea.
Just like that --
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
I think... something stung me.
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
Where are we?
General McAddie's.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I'm not taking any chances.
About the conspiracy?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
How?
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
You don't know the procedure.
Little boy?!  That's him!
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
You're kidding me.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
That's a secret.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
Yes.
Need we go through it all again?
In German?
How did you know I would be here?
I'm sorry.
Oh, well.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Thank you.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
He works in a military hospital.
It's true then?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Can I have that woman's passport?
What are you trying to say?
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
You've got plenty of contacts.
But he said he died instantaneously.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Vinkel.
Thank you.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
English?
Mr. Lime - yes.
I was told that he did not die at once.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Something wrong.
He didn't want to get involved.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Yes.
Okay.
Help you out?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Just five dollars, please.
Just take it, OK.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
One or two kilometers.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
A fin!
A bit fucking late.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
You can swim?
Eh - bonsoir.
Richard, you know something -
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Disease? What disease?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
Killing himself.
Oh, really?
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
No difference.
Do they?
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
I didn't realize you cared.
Nothing. Let's go....
How would you kill him?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Of course they're Jews.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Steve...
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Tell it to Hitler.
What kids?...
I've got to get back to the --
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
A Jewish prayer.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
You said they didn't have night guards.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
"Do chickens give milk?"
Obviously.
Just a little... What's the difference?
Fund-raising??
We think you'd be good at it.
They're not that Jewish.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
But your man isn't quite a God!
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
Hello!
Enzo Molinari.
I think I'll have a coffee.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Six seconds.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
It isn't lit yet.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Not at all!
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
Who?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
You jumped in?
I did?
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
You'll understand.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
You want to lie down for a while?
Promise you won't forget me.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
What?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Again?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Why is he doing this?
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Then, goodbye.
What's your first move?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
It's Friday.
Why not?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Who?
What are you doing that for?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Good evening.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Yes.
Charlie likes his leopard.
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Clo-Clo?
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Yes.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Yes. Do you mind?
Absolutely sure.
How do you know?
You a tourist?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Good.
You splendid bastard...
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Simplify and damn.
To get me killed...?
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
You wouldn’t understand.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
By your Austrian?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
What about your friendly cop?
Emily...
Have the money ready by 11am. We’ll call you.
No... No...  I swear...
Where?
Where are we?
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Got it. Puppies.
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Okay. Recommended...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Anything at all?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
What is?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
I’ll be alone.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Should I be?
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
Uh-huh.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
Then why don’t you reach him?
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
What sums?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Now?
I promise...
Yes...
What... what do you mean?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
Tell the king to give me more men.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I'm staying, Jean.
But that was her order!
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Scared of a girl?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
Who are you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
Yes... they were.
He's on the other side of the river.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
The English won't wait.
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes, it's a miracle.
Reinforcements?  Where??
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
No...!
Because... because you just can't!
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
I said, kneel!
I -- I -- I...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Because... I have to be alone!
Yes... lots of things!
No.  That was a sword in a field.
What for?
Are you sent by God?
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess.
Then... why are you here so often?
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
It's nothing.
Really?
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Dorota.
He'll be here soon.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Can you help us?
Who told you?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
That's better than yesterday.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Yes, but what good did it do?
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
No sound at all?
That is good, yes.
Baines is packing up?
Ohh the tag is broken.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
Yes, it's unholy.
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
Hello.
Tomorrow.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
What?
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Who are you?
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
He'd like to kill me.
All right, when?
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Then why the rat?
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
You got a system, Carver?
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He'll never do it.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
You better take a drink.
Another young man.
You're high enough.
Why not?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
You hand that over to the police.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
Yes.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Don't lie to me.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?
He's a brave man.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
She could tell you where father is.
I'll have to try to remember.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
He's holding out on you.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Nunheim!
Could this be him?
No.
Well....
I didn't know they had a fight.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Chris -- Chris -- !
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
I don't like him.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
What bonds?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Never mind.
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
Slim.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
Hello, baby.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
If you like 'em like that.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
You must admit I have good taste.
Macaulay.
I don't know.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What are you going to do?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You dog!
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Yes.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
Break it out.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
He...he could have been watching us.
We're at war.
What about Jaeger?
Blow me.
Wait.  Wait.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
Is it all right if I stand up?
No!
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Shoot them!
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Thanks.
Okay.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
What?
That's in two days.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Yes!
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Stress category.
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
What happened?
You've seen enough.
Eat your dinner.
I have to... he's a G-34
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
But...you...
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
No!...No!...
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What?
Where is LUH?
Why are you so concerned?
I want you for my roommate.
Shut up.
Where's LUH?
I'm only trying to help you.
I don't know. You tell me?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
What?
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Where you guys at?
Nothing.
Okay, let's go in.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
We've created a monster.
Alex-
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
What kind of bomb was it?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Yeah, just a nick ...
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
<u>Niente!</u>
Amsterdam?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
And harems ... ?
Like it?
I would start with cocktails.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Thank you.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I know it!
M'sieu ...
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major. 
Now just a minute, Major--
No, Captain, I tell you--
Seven and nine!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
What?
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily!
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
I remember.
Not particularly.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
M'sieu Laval!
Do you realize I have light eyes?
No. What is it? Tell me.
Make it out to cash!
Ye-es?
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Good night.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Like that?
But attractive--
On the night table.
Call the police?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
Divine ...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
Jacques!
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
For all the really important things--
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Because I hate him--because I love you!
I'm tryin' boss.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
An accident?!
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Bollocks.
Well I can.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
So don't marry him.
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I see you.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
A mistake?
You're right. Only you can do that.
To the stars.
It's okay. I'm alright.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Now it's worse.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
This is Miss Marsh.
I can explain--
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Get moving--
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
So you washed it off!
Very--your mother?
Don't rub it in.
When?
Thanks.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Lose?--I won a little--
--there's thousands of 'em!
You take some awful chances.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
<U>Me</U>!
Oh, yes. On the pier.
No--not quite.
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
I should say not.
Sure.
Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Sure.
What?
Knots!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
He's all right.
You can't bluff me any more.
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
All right.  Then what?
Not half as bad as I feel.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
What was that all about?
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
I laugh sometimes
Just doesn't, that's all.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Always?
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
So he can tell the story.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
But she doted on the frowner
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sir Elliot.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
- Instant melt-down.
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
- Four wheel drive?
Do you?
Political considerations?
How is old Q?
Does it work on cash machines?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
That's reassuring.
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
He was my father's best friend!
Trust me.
... We have time for that?
And when might that be?
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Stop it!
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Excellent.
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
We got the same thing.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I'm busy.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
It would be nice.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
It's only a tale.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Don't shout!
I was just trying to make conversation.
It is so considerate of you.
Just one?
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
You can't!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Then we've no time to lose!!
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Are you peeking?
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Nothing.
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Huh?
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Is that all?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You did what?
I've got a present for you...
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
So did I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Everything is gone, now.
It's all right, Finn.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
I don't know what you mean.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
I was just waiting for the right time.
Why?
Barbara --
Is this bad for him?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Like I give a fuck.
Sixteen
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
I get A's.  All A's.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Who do you work for?
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Not Tiger Woods.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
That thought makes me feel awful.
I don't think you're going to do that.
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
What is the name of your informant?
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
What do you look for?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
Just tell me where she is.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Christ.
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Oh, really?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No. Me Neither.
Cheers.
Right.
And you might get the fucking job.
Director?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
Cut it out.
But you don't have the money?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Your favourite dish.
Yeah.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
With a starship!
My pain?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Ah, Captain?
I've always known... I'll die alone.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Yes, Spock?
I cannot be certain.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
I did not.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
Now learn something about yourself.
No special conditions?

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
I belong here.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
You haven't told him?
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
I'm certainly not.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yeah...?
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Wrote the...?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not us, I hope.
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
That's all going to change, Yori...
I had to...in the games...
Then I owe you some thanks...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
Out.
Fine.
Why?
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Here they come.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
No!  Never!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
I agree.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
Good thinking, honey.
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
Yeah.  It was great.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes or no.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
I'm not wearing any.
You wouldn't believe me.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Is it working yet?
God, you have great legs.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Those idiots.
He said he was an American agent.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
You'll call me then?
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
I'd love some pie.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
I just gotta get somethin'.
Write down Drexl's address.
... was so romantic.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
I heard that.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Yeah.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
Every word of it.
I certainly hope so.
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot Blitzer.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Let me handle this.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
No. No, you don't.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Why does he trust you?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Keep it.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Not a tiny little vial -
Or a supporting actor -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
- Because it's good!
Read my lips.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Sorta room-mates?
Exactly room-mates.
How do you know? You been there?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Well, you go down Beechwood...
What's she doing?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
What year do you think it is?
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
I've got one now.
Jeffrey Mason?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
See -- you can drive after all!
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
The gun! ... I lost it
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Hey, man...
Who am I supposed to shoot?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
He no!
Maybe I do.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
You don't fear death?
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
More or less.
Same back at you.
Will be.
One way, or round trip?
Yeah.  Just a little short. Figures.  I just wanted to get out, that's all.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
What time is it now?
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
No charge.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
You got the money?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
They look nice.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What does it look like?
No trouble at all, really.
You're welcome, Grace.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Like you.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
I don't know how.
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
We'd have to kill him.
John, please--
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Can you climb back up.
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
What for?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Grace, tell him.
Accident.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would I what?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Do we shake hands?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
Liar.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Come on, Jake--
Christ, Jake, please--
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Oz.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
How old are you?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Stand up.
Give it to me!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
But, Senor--
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Hell no!
...And everything is nothing too.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
A lot that means.
Accident.
An overheated car.
Wait a second--
Would I what?
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
You love her, but you hate her?
No!
What are you talking about!
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Get away from me!
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Darrell--
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I want my car.
Where you headed?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Where'd you learn to do that?
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
How do you know he's still not here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
But I thought --
What are you talking about?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
My mother died in this canyon.
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Harlin's.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Which you don't have.
One way, or round trip?
What was that all about?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Wow.
Yes.
Four.
What about Jeb?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
out again?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
Was it serious?
What was your idea Elijah?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
But not a knife?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I mean if you knew karate?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Jeremy listen to what--
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Is that right?
Is David Dunne there?
No.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Innocent of what?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
Nope.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
Huh?
Been gone near three years now.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Tell me right off if you see him.
You can shoot him.
First one what?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Beats the hell out of me.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Nothin's bent.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
See that scrub oak yonder?
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
Yeah.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
They fucking know everything.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Fenster and Hockney?
Maybe more.
Hungarian?
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
Neither do we.
Did they charge him with anything?
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
You know damn well what I think.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
No.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Yes.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
That's right.
Yes!
No.
How is that?
You would not...?
Just now...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
'Code Blue'...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Yes...I...yes.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Yes.
Yes.
) I'm sorry ...?
The most respected ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
How come you're calling me from...?
Kathy Price.
Still looking.
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
That's what I am.
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
No.
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
...he's a good man...
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
No.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
It's locked?
... I'm sure you do ...
... fifty thousand dollars?
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
Thanks, Franky.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
Where'd she go?
Nothing.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
It's a place to live, that's all.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Because I remind you of her?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow morning.
Yes.
No.
Please! And don't look at me.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
I want to! Come on!
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
They're none of them right.
Judy --
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
Yes. Yes, I do.
Wherever you'd like...
That's what I had in mind.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
Take me away...
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
We'll find him.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
At...
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
I... didn't know where you lived.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Well... anywhere in particular?
How can you be sure?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
Madeleine!
What do you remember?
No... it's in shadow.
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
No!
It's all there. It's no dream.
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
Too late... there's something I must do...
To the church, I must go there.
Let me go! Let me go!!
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Yes... you run this hotel.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Normal.
Three whole weeks.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Do you know him well?
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Around.
What is it, a still life?
No, not exactly. Want to see?
By whom?
What?
What's that?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
Go home!
You go home!
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
I'm calling the ambulance.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Sure, why not.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
You got us into this mess.
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Don't eyeball your kids.
What happened? Oh my God...
Where's the bathroom?
Well, oh...
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
I'm not talking to you?
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
Shut up.
I'm calling the police.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
You always were a jealous man.
He's having a problem here.
Boyd...What have we done?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
Isn't it a little late?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
True.
New king.
Ball park sausages.
How about my Fatburger?
Are we supposed to?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Photographer?
Florist?
How could I know what else I forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Who else?
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Honey I don't have the time...
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
What are you doing?
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
Do you love me?
You fucked a prostitute?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
What money?
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
What?
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Go for it.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I got to agree with that.
What?
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
My God...
What song?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
...embarrassing, shameful...
A mutant species.
No, the children sleep with me.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Are there many windows?
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
You see, even the voice.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Whatever you like.
Wasn't that cowardice?
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Go away! Leave me alone.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Are you Jorge?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
Do they worry you that much, then?
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
No.
Why?
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
No, I don't want to.
Me? What did I do?
Why wasn't I told?
Whatever.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What about them?
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
I need your help--
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
It feels so.. .real.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me, what?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
A little less than yesterday.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
What you need is a collar.
I know who would know.
Who said that?
This is my area of expertise.
I'm doing the best I can!
Start of what?
Authority still makes me nervous.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Part of him is.
That, or living through him...
Lindenmeyer?
I don't know.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
My...secret.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
It's <u>producing</u>.
What can it hurt is they offend me.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Come on.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Who would find out?
Who's gonna tell'em.
...that's the general idea.
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
...<u>nothing</u>...
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
...I just hope...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Hello?   No, operator...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
What do you think would hold it off?
Remember the Maine...
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
W...what?
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
...but...
Naw, naw, we own the airways... 
Watch me.
What guards Us Against Canada...?
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
No problem.  Here's the...
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
It concerns his future!
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Get the hell out!
Start unloading.
Speak English will ya.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
I don't know anything!
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Oh no, no...
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
...I can't even see it...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
...Gordon.
How much?
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
I can't...and I won't.
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah, yeah, OK
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Jenkins!
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Vell.  Goodnight.
Come on.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
China
So Mark, what's so urgent?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
YES!
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
That's not true.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
So much.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
What?
Then we both are.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Well, that's what we're here for.
I am.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
This fence...it's so...
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
It's fine.
He was so pissed.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Kambucha mushroom tea...
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Please.  That's all I need.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
But Claire--
Relieved?
I know.
What is it?
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
To make sure she's all right.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Unless you need me to come home...
No, no.  It's fine.
In the house.  I was scared.
What's going on, Claire?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Well, that's a relief.
Norman...
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
This is the Feur thing?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Really big bed.
Call ya later.
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
I...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
...Please stop...
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
To Caitlin!!
Stop...
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
How can you be sure?
Claire...
I know.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I don't believe you.
MADISON!
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
What are you talk---
I want to see my mother.
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
It is from love.
I don't know what you are!!!
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
My jury's still out on that,
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I like him.  He can stay.
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Yes - I have had it for years.
Where do you kill them...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
STEPHANIE?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Open it...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
I am sorry...
He doesn't need to...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
Don't worry about it -
Yes...?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
I better go, Dad.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Dead?
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
We reinvented ourselves.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Everything.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Most places are, Jimmy.
My room?
Just a formality.
I didn't forget.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
You never know around here.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
But absolutely true.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
But how would we pay our bills?
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Tipping?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
Bad news.
It's about your parents.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Thanks.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Just check out the car.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
No.
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
And what do they say?
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
You can trust me.
You are.
Whichever one I want.
You notice my new jumper?
I miss Dad.
No you don't.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
God, I've been calling you.
Duquette.  Forget him...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
That's not your line.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Yes.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Hi, Sandy.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Almost?
Uh... how long ago was this?
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
But it only has six legs.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Fine, I'll stop.
Private train?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
French?
When are they coming?
You're not going to use it, are you?
What is Tir Asleen?
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
I have no family.
He's no magician.
He turned that monster into stone!
Why.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You hear trouble.
Of course!  I promise!
Because she's sick.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
Watch it!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Burn it to a fine ash.
What's the magician's weapon?
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
Just do it!
Surrender!!
Madmartigan.
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Maybe milking.
Good, you start tomorrow.
...I want to say a thing.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Are they going to kill you?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Have you got your gun on now?
Amish.
Maybe.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Move! Or you die right here!
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
We do not go into your courts.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
You couldn't wait until morning?
But –
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
You're so sure of that?
It won't happen again.
Listen to me – Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
I hear you.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I'm coming.
Not yet.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
But... if you had to guess?
I know.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Oh --
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Stop her!
...Oh, did that hurt?
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh-oh-
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Look -- it ticks!
Oh, my!
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, come on.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Did I scare you?
They would?
Yes -- that's true.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
I don't blame you for that.
To Oz!
Here -- here --
The other side....
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Leave her alone!
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
And you're going to lead us.
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
I want to see you and your wife right away....
You mean she bit you?
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
You know something?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Elektra King.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Renard.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Partially, yes.
You’re not going to.
I know.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
You are out of your league.  She’s working with Renard.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Please.
Your father...
Why?  What's the problem?
Wrong answers?
We don't know that.
Hello, Adrian.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Veidt¹s complex.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
And what if you¹re wrong?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
His . . . whatever.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Okay!
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
I don't think she's coming with us.
Isn't it true that you --
Please.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Is that a fact?
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Like what?
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Go to hell.
I was invited. What's your story?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
Let's do this.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Been to any good diners lately?
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
We have to find Magneto.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He takes himself seriously.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Who?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
What do you want with him?
The way what is going to be?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Yes, sir.
Baack!
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Yes.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Darling!
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
Good.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
How old are you, young man?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
I see.
You must be Igor.
I beg your pardon?
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Did you hear that strange music?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
I have a pretty good idea.
I want that brain.
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
... I'm glad that's...
Yes, Master!
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
Is everything ready?
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
How nice.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well...
Inga, wake up!
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
What a filthy mess.
But who was playing it?
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Nor to Elizabeth.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
But will they make good use of them?
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
