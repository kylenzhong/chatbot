You got something on your mind?
Well, no...
do you listen to this crap?
Great
Queen Harry?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Like you care.
Why?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I just wanted --
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
That I'm used to.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Where ya goin?
Two legs, nice rack...
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
How'd you do it?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
What'd he say?
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
What's this?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
You 're so --
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Fallacy.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No one else knows
You know what I mean
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
What?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Right.
He's the devil's child...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Passion is something one cannot control!
I am listening, my son.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
What's he doing?
The land is there.  I know it!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
You bring the cigarettes?
What about Oleg?
No, he is here.  Shit...
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What's your cut?  How much?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Yes, I considered it.
What about back home?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
It was my decision, not his.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
No, what is it?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
I'll come with you.
I'm on duty.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Okay, til tonight.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Okay.
How old are your kids?
Any chance we can do that again?
I am butcher.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
How long are you planning to stay?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
I did.
Why not?
What is that?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Credit?
Did you hurt her?
I can get you a job.
Viewer discretion advised!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Yes...he's my friend.
That's what it looks like to me.
What was that?
I'll take him.
No way!  He's mine!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
I'll send a cop back for you.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
Yes.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Are you reasonably awake?
Two more.
It's the last one.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I will if I can, Frank.
Yeah?
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No chance.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
You here to write my life story?
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
You're crazy.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
There.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Half a million.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Yeah...
That's what you say, Cates...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Hey, you're right.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
You sure you want me to?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
How do you know?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Tell me.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
How would you know?
Stall.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want to go outside?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Of course.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Uh... at least fifty.
Hello?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
...Hi.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
What did you say? What did you do?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
And the third one?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Why not?
...Shit!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Learning language.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
You noticed..
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I told you not to read all that crap!
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
This thing solid?
They just landed in the desert.
Wait or act.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I know.
Why the gun?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
You're killing me...
What?
What are these?
What you see is what I got, mister.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
And they are?
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Excellent.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Celebrity Films.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Where?  Show me where.
I never killed anyone.
You are a private investigator?
Give me the film.
How long you been working there?
There's not much illegal.
Child pornography.
Specialty product.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Nothing remotely like this.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
What is this?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
It was bad.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Is there something we can do?
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
What?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
Excuse us, dear.
The tickets.
Yeah...I guess.
Very funny.
Alice!
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
He sure loves to stay awake.
They think I'm nuts.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Poor woman...
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
You could train someone else.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Yeah?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Yes, Griff?
Why do you say that?
Who with?
What do you think?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
What are you boys up to?
Tell me.
I plan to. Soon.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Don't mind if I do.
No brag. Just fact.
Like you and Gordon?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
You know.
Break stuff?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Fuck you.
What's the hurry?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
See. Get your boots.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Coffee's perked.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
How was she?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Get some sleep.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Wade, are you alright?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
He didn't leave us.
How was...  ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
They aren't answering their hails.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
How many others killed?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Stand by.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Yes
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
I miss you. And I miss her.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
You give me ulcers.
WE'RE HOOKED!
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Felt like a large asteroid.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine, what happened to us?
If that's the way you want it.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I mean for Ted.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I think so.
Negative.
That's okay, ROK.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Scraps.
What should I say?
Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
You folks need any help?
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Do you want to talk about it.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Airsick?
You promise you'll write.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Yes?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
William Harcourt?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Well... yes, quite possibly.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Well, let's roll, George.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Yeah, Sykes?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
How long until it blows?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Hear me out...
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Alive?
Well you're not reading it right!
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Locked.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Fifteen meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Terrible.
They're dead.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You promise?
Don't go!  Please.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
I knew you'd come.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
What does he look like?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
And how will you make him keep it?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
No! No! No!
That's stupid.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Well, don't do that again!
Stanzi!
Wolfi.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Why not?
Frau Mozart?
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
It is miraculous.
Tonight?
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
This is not his handwriting.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Gertrude!
What a strange young man.
A-flat, Majesty.
And the result satisfies.
Why not?
Majesty!
Why so?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Ah, love again.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Don't you have a maid?
It couldn't be better.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
You don't have secrets from me.
Father -
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Where does he work?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Is he working?
Is he working?
German!
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Did you like it, then?
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Of course not.
I can't say. Really
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
What work?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
This is only a vaudeville.
Would you? Actually, you could.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
What?
We ended in F Major?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Herr Mozart -
Are they?
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
How well are you trained in music?
No? Was Mozart a good man?
What?
Yes.
No, you didn't!
Exactly.
That lady is back, sir.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
How did he look?
Go about your duties.
No, why?
Yes, I should think so.
Call me David.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Are you better now?
Closet.
Do me an enormous favor?
Don't you remember?
But...
What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
There's no call for that kind of language.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
What time is it?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
I really don't know.
Yes.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
You're talking about the woman I love.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Jack, we'd better go.
A coyote.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
I don't know. Come on.
Yeah.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
It's you, David.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Get out of here, Jack!
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
And what, Sergeant?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
About twenty-four thousand.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
What good will that do?
What do you mean, help?
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
The theatre?
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes?
Sure, I think it's swell.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Did you get the case for the securities?
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
I'm afraid so.
No.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Well . . . ?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
What did you find out, Mike?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
You can ride like that?
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
The Army can hang him.
What?
I could use the walk.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Well?
They gonna rush us?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
What is it?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Daddy, don't start with this again.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
I reckoned.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
That just might work.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Can't argue that.
Uncle Frank?
How much of that story is true?
A fair number, Ma.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Riders --
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
You didn't want to farm?
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
What?
Ahh, you'll miss me.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
You okay, Jesse?
Well, not exactly.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
How much did they get from the safe?
What is that?
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
So he's won.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Can you put men at all four?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Uh huh.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Evelyn?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Good coloring.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Are you my two o'clock?
What exactly do you mean?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
No, you...didn't?
Where are you going?
That's Paul Owen.
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Oh, something. . romantic?
I'll do it.
Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Want a bite?
Patrick? Is that you?
What do you think I do?
Well...
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
You're at Paul Owen s.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
How old are you?
No, I guess it's okay.
Yeah...Yale thing.
He had a yacht?
No.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Don.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, I could he wrong.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Listen, what's your name?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I'm just screwed.
It's important.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
When's Brian coming for the TV?
I know, I know.
What're you -- what?
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Guilt?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
...wanna savor this.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He wasn't acting?
And Outpost? You're happy there?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Okay.
What?!
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
We tried!
He's pretty tight with his family.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
You've been coming in early.
That's great! Thanks.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
But why would they --?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
What?
A what?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
You mean -- break in?
I don't know --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Bring it to the other location.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Hungry.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Good luck, Austin.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Hey, Mick!
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why did you leave so soon?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Fancy a nibble?
Oh, yes you are.
Of course, luv.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
No, did you use a condom?
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Yes.
Shut up.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I love you, Austin.
Kiss me.
Noooooooooooooo!
Oh my God, he's back.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
Did you ever...
Well, it's kind of weird.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Mr. John Steed, please.
Then who wins?
Hmmm ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
You're mad.
Rules are made to be broken.
I didn't. Mother did.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Is that written in his shoe?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Do you always drive this fast?
This must be the last straw.
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
You're playing games.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
What's that you're wearing?
Trubshaw again? What now?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
Where are you going?
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Who's now vanished.
I was getting to it.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Global warming?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Amnesia?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Where?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
I've decided not to run for President.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
And...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Five thousand dollars.
Seventy-five hundred.
The car for Debbie?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes, sir, I am.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
What are we having?
You're going to have a bachelor party?
It looks awful.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Let go of me!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Why?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
What can I be doing for you?
Is that all the coke in the place?
You want to share it?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
I'm not really hungry.
Right in there, pal.
I don't know.
He look familiar?
Very.
Hey, you guys...
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
In the Field Museum once.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Goddamn it Stephen!
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Thanks for calling.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Well, you did invite me here.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Then why did you quit?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- I work for the city.
Yes.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
What?
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
So what do you want me to do?
Coffee sucked.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
"Don?"
Don't you have any leads at all?
People.
Yeah.
Who?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Let me think about it.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Ho!
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Give me some?
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
What do I do?
You might be right.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Damn skippy.
You can walk away.  We both can.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
I would like to change your name.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Where do you go from here?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Manray!
Do you know how you will use him?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Why'd you do that?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Yes, your name?
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
What you did is dead wrong.
I don't believe it.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Let Myrna finish.
I never had a really real pair before.
What do you mean?
Money and nothing else?
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...yes she did.
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
What else?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
And his baggage?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
The coward!
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I don't know.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Then you yield to me.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Have you not a man whom you value?
How so?
Will we always leave it at this?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
All the same, you must name an amount.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What do we do?
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
That son of a bitch.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Oh, come on --
That's exactly what he says about you.
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
I didn't kill him --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
How are you?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
I'm sorry, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
The very same.
I plan to grow on you.
Something wrong?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Watch me.
I didn't shoot West...
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Four --
What?
Your phone number?
What are you talking about?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Poor fucker my ass...
Fifty minutes.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Bullshit --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
We know.
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Yes!
Fine, I will.
How would you describe him?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
No, I understand.
Can I take your picture?
Really?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You mean, while I'm here.
I will.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Like this.
Really.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Hello.
Mmm.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
How is he?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
You know what for.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
Say thank you.
What was that?
You're asking for my documents?
Uh. Do you like England?
Oh nothing.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
Put the fucking kettle down.
He wants money.
Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
In every sense. If at all possible.
What? No you're not..
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
I don't hate you.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
What happened between you and the blonde?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
It's not mine either.
What are you doing?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Yes?
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
Hey.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Why you got me chained?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
What I love.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
The hell is this shit?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
You a preacher?
Yeah?
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
I think she got to you, pappy.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Back-up.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Nick, we can't just --
What'd she say?
How'd you get this?
You can't come in.  They don't want --
I want to go talk to him.
It's very small.
No...
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Start it.
What's that for?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
They want your autograph.
You'll get Ich killed.
I still think you're a bastard.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
The families who control the casinos?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
One man.  He must be good.
Then go get him.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Also extraordinary things.
Why are you staring at us?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Just thought I'd...
What's going on down there?
When?
Six, huh?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
I was just about to have my dinner.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.  I got it.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You equipped for random questions?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
How old am I?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Yes?
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
Who?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
So?
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
What do you want me to do?
You did?
Who is this?
Dead.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Where the hell you been?
Is this to be an empathy test?
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Come where?
How do you do?
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
It was amazing.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
And that's it?
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Why not go to work for me?
Two weeks.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
They're all divorced?
Get out!
Thank-Q!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Where's he gone?
He has a computer?
The guy with the underpants!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
What?
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Sing it to me.
...I do.
Yes, it is.
Is this because of the radiation?
A card?
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
These are wonderful.
Your mom made that all by herself.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Russia.
I just don't want to.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Of what?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
Sure.
I do alright.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
No.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
All back East.
Good god.
You got a light, honey?
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
You hear that?!
How long will we have to stay down here?
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Home sweet home!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Calvin?!
What did you wish for, Adam?
If we still have one.
In the generator room again?
Mutants?!
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I am the head of this household--
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Some time.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Go to the bathroom.
Uh, yes, you do.
He didn't leave with them.
He left with Sophie.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
The criminals are winning.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Nobody.
Then you got undressed.
I, I don't know.
Sure I'm alright. 
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Yes.
Yes.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
Oh no.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
He's comin' back? What for?
Hello, daddy.
Heineken.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
There ya go.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Do you want the car?
No. No thank you.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Uh-uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Brilliant.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
Who, me? Why should it?
Okay, be careful.
You were late.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Yeah, we promise.
We paid attention in school.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
I don't know they just always need it.
Aye.
We do not want your tired and sick.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Of course they were. How many?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Twist of lemon!
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
You're right.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Continue the joke.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
What about them?
I'll say it.
You owe me fifty bucks.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
He told you and you let him do it.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.
I'm not. But there's --
When'd you get back?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Roger.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Like amnesia.
He did?
Pretty much everything.
How big is it?
So how is it in there? 
What?
You mean like techniques?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Me?
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Who?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
I hope not.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Anthony, I --
No, I don't mind.
Uh-uh.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Is that him?
Well, what do you think?
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
You stole a Trans-Am.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
You really think he'll remember you?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Bob, that makes no sense.
Come on, Dignan.
I can't do that, Bob.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Where's Applejack?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Wait a second --
Oh, yeah.
What?
I want to know about Treadstone.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
May I finish?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
What do you want?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Pamela Landy?
You called it in?
No. There's nothing new.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
-- where's left to go? --
What?
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I did.
Why is she trying to kill me?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Why am I alive?
What's that?
-- go -- take the van! --
This is everything? Is there.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Amnesia?
But... what will you do?
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
You'll move
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
I want... to marry you!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Tonight then.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
There must be a way to fix this.
Where are you now?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
I thought you were a December baby.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Huh?
Ouch.
I deserve a lot worse.
I've stopped a hundred times.
Not if you remember my dad.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
Ha! Where's that?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Because you're... different.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
There's one major hole in your story.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And...?
We'll find out soon enough.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Destroy it?
Look what you made me do!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Meant no offense.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
-- Will he keep his word?
You want my advice?
Good.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
I see.
No thanks, Carl.
Goodnight.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
No.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
That's too far ahead to plan.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Goodnight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
-- Yes?
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Had a close one, eh?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. It's all arranged.
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Mademoiselle.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Huh?
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Get me the Radio Tower!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Boss!
Do too much, I'll die.
Do too little you'll die.
Take it.
Take it, damn it.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
You know what happened to this?
Well, not really, I --
Had a package to deliver.
I had it on the island with me.
I've got lots of time.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
He's your cute thing.
You can't go now.
Could you watch Jango?
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
Her name's Hannah.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
Yes, yes he did.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
What about the sender?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Forget it.
That's why you're a gambling man.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
I braided them.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Only if you can afford it.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Where's Mandalay?
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You mean somebody asked?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
That's a heavy sedation.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
At what altitude?
It's almost like flying.
So. What should I do now?
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Uh... sure.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
We heard that one already, Homer.
Rose Rose?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
You okay, Rose?
You're not yet three months, are you?
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
Don't this place look like home?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Silicon Valley?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
We had to finalize the deal.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Gee... What makes you say that?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
She had you tempting fate.
We were back on.
We'll take care of it.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
What? I can feel you looking at me.
And what about Big Al?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Minus one.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
I need you to stake me.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
You get an equal cut.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
No, I want my cut!
What do you want? An apology?
Tick-tock...
It's bad luck.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Escorts!
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
What'd he say?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Stand up.
Sorry. What?
In over your head?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Then who's the Banker?
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
It's just insurance.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
I found her in bed with someone.
I don't gamble.
And your lady?
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Great.
I've lived there.
First visit to London?
Toss you for it.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
What happened?
I didn't.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Who's they?
And I thought you were only after my body.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It won't.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
I can't do it, Jani.
Do you?
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
How are you?
Who...
You did?
Have I?
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
What happened to Bella?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
I put them on together.
Where did you go to school?
I was at Beadles.
I make it six.
You want me to check?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
Yes.
Fine.
I just want the job.
Does he win?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
I like it up here.
Not now!
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
What's that, sir?
Ah... pity, pity...
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Oh, yeah?
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Where'd you clip this?
Same old story.  Not interested.
A grand.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Damn... Are you alright?
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Too early to tell.
I won't be staying.
Bent.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Yes on all counts.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
How much do you know?
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
A girl.
You said you could help.
Your help.
I already don't like the sound of this.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
With your help.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Then what?
Nothing on Hannah?
As long as you're okay.
How's this about me?
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's got my word.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Max--
Really?
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
A toy?
And why should she?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
More like deployed in bed asleep.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Got any KISS?
No problem.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
No... You don't think...?
Dude, this is all I got.
Jam, listen up.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
I'm really sorry about that, man.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
They're not idiots.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
But we took the keys?
Are you AFRAID?
Donnie.
So... that's it?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Who is... we?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
So... you just moved here?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
We're moving through time.
Are you okay?
What's wrong with you?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Where are you going?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
So, I met a new friend.
Yes.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
A sign from whom?
How does that make you feel?
Nothing.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
That I did it again.
I think now that he might...
What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
That's enough.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Yep.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Chut up!
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Loretta, never have kids.
Thank God for bunge cords.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Your parents'd kill you.
Mrs. Leeman?
I'm gonna need more caps.
Mom!
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
This, this... This is bullshit!
Yes...
Okay... well, bye.
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
You don't know where this is gonna...
We was robbed.
Yeah.
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Lester?
Gladys! Stop it!
That's enough!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
What!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
My dear President...  read it back...
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My dear"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Here I am, Father...
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
What other job you got?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
So! -- He's on your side, too.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
That's even a greater honor.
Go ahead.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You swine!
You worm!
Then it's war?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Why -- why -- of course.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
John loves the house.
You stay with me.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
What happened?
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
How long has this man been here?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Have you read it?
Of course! You want out?
Oh, yes.
Thank you... very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
The main spire.
Righteousness for his namesake.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Good evening. How are you feeling?
Yes.
How long will I stay here?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Good morning, John.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Yes John?
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Well...
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
I've never LOVED anybody!
Who?
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
What about the raping?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
You don't love ME.
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
What a stupid idea.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
How deep IS the ocean?
I know!
We're missing all the fun...
You talking piffle, son?
SHUT UP!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
Who gets killed?
But HOW?
ROW!
Yeah... well...
Do what?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
What are you talking about?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Together we stand!
Made by YOU, Loki!
I must only let the red rage...
I must KILL! Kill!
No... he's not... not... there...
And something to sharpen them with?
No, Mother.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Come over after I'm done here?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Rockville Center.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I don't really know how --
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
It's pretty.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
You'll call me, right?
Tomorrow?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Joely...
Is that what you want?
Yeah?
Well, you're married.
I remember that speech really well.
Probably.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
yeah?
Me too. There's this poem --
I knew.
So go.
Oh, um...
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Your dried cum.
How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Clementine.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I miss you.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
You found us okay?
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Where?
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Hey.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks.
That's lovely.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
We can't do this.
I have a family, Mary.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Does that help?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Clockworks.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I don't.
Where are the others?
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Well.... er...
Yep.
I'm the best.
A born freak can only go uphill.
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Coop, where are you...
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
What...?
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
What happened?
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Justin.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
It's complicated...
What do you want me to say?
Yes...
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
You can't, your orders are specific...
You can't leave. She won't let you.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
Heading three-three-four...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
Who?
Go ahead.
You've got to listen...
What's going on in there, Starck?
What?
He's been past Mars?
He served on the Goliath.
He's engaged the override.
Hey...
What?
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
Get them back --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
What about his first born?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Isn't that your speech?
We had a tough year.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
And where do we think we're going?
Not this again --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Then what is it?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
That's good. That's uh... good.
Are you kidding?
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
First door on your left!
This is how I dress all the time.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Is everything okay at work?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Leave me alone.
Get a ride with somebody.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Did you get her number?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Seen the new Playboy?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
He was hot, wasn't he?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
What's the big deal?
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
I paid for it and everything.
Where's Doug?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
I made a fool of myself.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Are you ready to order here?
Two Cokes.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Damn right!
Where's the medicine?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
How long do I have?
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Shoot it.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
The cops?
WELL? What are your plans?
Me?
It's gone too far.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Yes!
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
I will not die because of him!
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Where's that?
You got something better?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
What's in the back?
What is this?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Two.
Holds four.
Keys.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I wouldn't do that, son.
Gimme the keys.
Move it!
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
HELP MEEE!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Am I too heavy for you?
Hey!
Not without you!!!
You know you don't have to do this.
I'll do anything to help.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
Where's Clifford?
An actress.
A rich actress.
I know, but --
Dick, we need some time apart --
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
I didn't have much to do with it.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Of course.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Good.
Age?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Are you really serious? About acting?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Harry.
Well? What'd you think?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
What's left of my blood.
What for?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
And?
Take a walk, pal.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Where to?
I don't know.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
And no people.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
I think I need a little air.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Please sit down...
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
What?
What?
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
Kill me and have done with it.
A brain. Extremities.
She's beautiful.
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
You dance so beautifully together.
Are you all right?
I wish to be your husband.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Your decision. For us.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Why the change? What about your work?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Henry Clerval.
Only you would think of that!
You can't. Death is God's will!
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Trouble?
You said we were special.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Chance to get even?
Holy shit...
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
That was the telephone.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
It's just a dream.
Mmmmmmmph?
Girls can't be cowboys.
Anything else you want?
That's thirty percent.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
What's this guy's problem?
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Jacob.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Was? As in not anymore?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To your family.
What's this stuff?
I promise.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
What?
What you said to me in the room.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
You're gonna let us go?
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Hot goddamn day!
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Where's the woman?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Really?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
You could take their head off.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
That's what I hear.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
I'm fine, sir.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
See me, sir?
Ah, c'mon...
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
California.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
What changed?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I'm sure it is.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
I can make this wall without --
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Chances of recovery?
So dump on me.
Jordan...
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Should I be afraid?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I think you're the liar.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
O'Neil...
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
O'Neil, Jordan.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
What are you doing here?
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
Do I know you?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
I think we should leave now.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I won't and nothing you say-
What?  What?
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
What the hell is going on?!!?
What's happened?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
The enemy is matching velocity.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
I am SO SICK of being right.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Because it was on the show!
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Then how did he find out about the device?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
But there it is!...
Could be this.
Do your best, Tommy...
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Continue forward, sir?
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
WHAT? WH
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
You seem pleased by the prospect.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
A lot of years have gone by.
What?  What are you talking about?
No.  I guess.
No, my lord.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
They are... friends of Congress.
Let's not over do it...
Makes you gag.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
You must be very rich.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
I feel the same, sir.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
That's a lie!
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
What are you doing?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
Just because they are born?
Yes!
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
You're kidding me, right?
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Who?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
You get life for kidnapping.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
Your who?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
I don't believe this.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
C-18.
Depends. Who's this?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
You live in Miami?
Something shouldn't be there.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
You just did.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
He drown?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Twenty seven hundred.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
One of mine?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Like this?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
You've been losing.
What're you doing here?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Rough day on the set?
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Why not?
Are you going down?
I don't know.
That's what the guy said.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Hm?
You seem to feel fine about it.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Be quiet and listen.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Harry -–
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
'We?'
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
What? You sure?
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
What day is it?
I don't know. Tuesday?
Roger.
Ready?
So we kill him?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
What about running number two by itself?
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
On a passenger ship in 1953?
You smashed it!
What?!
If money can buy what he wants.
Could be a fishing boat.
Coffee.
Coffee?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
The same day she supposedly went down.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
It's not gonna hold us.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
What's that supposed to mean?
They went crazy.
You killed them.
You got that right.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
You're up late.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
I heard that.
Greer?
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
What about the gold?
Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
What's this?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
What?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Are you going to yell at me?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
And what can you tell us about this... 
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Uh-oh.
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Are you the one who left that note?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why not?
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
Hi, Al!
Look at how cute I am!
Which loser?
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
What was that all about?
How about this one?
How about this?
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You're insane.
What happened to Seymour?
Just some people from work...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
It's fine.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Seymour does.
Hey, where are you going?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Shh!
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Yes, that would certainly do...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
Yeah, sure. Of course.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
Yeah, well... me neither...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
They're Seymour's.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Pleasant journey?
I do need to see Starling.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Have you ever failed?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
Where is it?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Okay, that's no problem.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
What is it, honey?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I know.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Who are they?
These boys aren't playing around.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
So far so good.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
From where -- Neptune?
I'm Egon --
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Rivers of the stuff!
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
This is what you do with your spare time?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
What kind of tests?
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
What's your story, Pete?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Is it a star?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Is that your professional opinion?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Are you Peter Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
May I please see the storage facility?
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Yes.  I don't like this.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Did you see anything?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Gozer.
What do we do now?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
They will.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Ray -- Something's here.
How do you know?
Who was the architect?
Do you believe in God?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Judgement Day ...
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Don't you think you should at least wave?
For the gods, spit it out!
Yes?  Go on!
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
They won't break this one.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
The Senate too?
You're hearing about somebody else.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
As soon as I can.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
He's very realistic.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Greeks?
What about their philosophy lessons?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Yes.
Aren't you eating?
No -- why should I?
Will you take me home now?
I think I'd better go home now please.
But could you try?
Did they ever find out?
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
What's the matter?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
What is it?
What?
Don't cry. 
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Because -- I am.
What do you think?
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
My belt.
Are you going home?
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
You won't?
When?
I don't know.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
You're not one of those agitators?
Oh -- no sir.
Well here's the purse.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
Can I help you, sir!
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
Sir?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Did you know that?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
It's all right.
All right. Now finish your drink.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Let me out!
Yes, I do.
May I sit down?
He didn't see me.
What?
I got a single room.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Thank you.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
If you want.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well?
Oh.
Don't you?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you really want me to?
What novel did you read.
There!
We're talking.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
I don't.
What?
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Yes.
At college.
Well how did it happen?
Really. I want to know.
I have my reasons.
Well, I'm not.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
How?
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
No -- actually I'm not --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
What?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
I do.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
You got me.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
I will.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
That's quite a statement.
Mrs. Robinson?
It's Benjamin.
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
Is anything wrong?
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Well?
No.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
You can't.
Who?
Dictation.  You know...
What?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You're very funny --
Chasing around.
Chasing what?
Will you do me a big favor?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
Oh!
What do you want here?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Yes -- I do understand.
What can you see?
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
Really?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
Very early in the morning.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Thank you, sir.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
All right then.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
I thought she was splendid!
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
The war.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Good heavens. What for?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
No, Doctor.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Everything?
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
No - absinthe.
Really?
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
You don't understand that do you?
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Moreover --
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
You pay me.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Skiing? 
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Tomorrow morning.
Insolent young cub!
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Madam should sleep.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Why not?
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Next week.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
What you need is some relaxation.
What do you want with her?
Hi, Bobo.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
You know it, Lilly.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
I certainly hope not.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Not much time.
Why? What's wrong?
It's not your fault.
Whadaya say?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Bluebell came in?
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
What's that?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
No.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
That's right.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Roy?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Every day in every way.
I'm a salesman.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You were gone for a while.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
Don't I get any say in this?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
That's natural.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
No question, huh?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
I can be real stiff.
Detective...
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
What the fuck are you talking about?
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Why not?
What are you doing here?!
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Still wants to move out?
It's not going to happen.
Better her than me.
Shit, Linda!
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Why?  You interested?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Who are you?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
But surely Rogers isn't --
No one.
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
It's a bitch.
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least!
Tell them yourself!
Go home!
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Excuse me.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
You did?
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I wanted to apologize.
Blue soup.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Anybody home?
Hello.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
He worships Father.
It makes life spicy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
"The sting."
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Will you go to bed?
Gee whiz, Dad--
Like hugging a lamp post.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
We thought a doctor might help.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
What then?
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
No you're not!
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Did you like it, dear?
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
Two hundred years old.
Blue soup?
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
I'm going to call the police.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Ooops.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
You've been bitten by bats?
I was going to ask.
We have, have we?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
What brought you back?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
I'm high as a kite.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
You hope.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
Was I ever of use?
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
No.  No.
Thank you--for my life.
What are you going to do?
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
For what?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
How did she lose her feet?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
That's something I suppose.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Is he coming home?
You're saying no.
What kind of a life is that?
We've got to rescue him.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
Do you want to take a session?
Pull out your cock.
Are you going to stiff me?
That's cool.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Yeah.
Is this all the display space we can get?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Do you know where she lives?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
You're not a film producer, are you?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
He deals in pain.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
More or less.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Andy.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
It's just a name.
What happened, pilgrim?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
What happened?
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where!
What?
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
In other words, you want to get laid?
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Sounds all right.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Oh, I don't have one.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Harold Chasen.
Do you dance?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
It's very interesting.
No.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Certainly a new experience for me.
Because they are all the same.
It is kind of rough.
What were you fighting for?
He's stopped.
What was that?
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Maude, do you pray?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
Fifteen.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
I don't know.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Thank you, Uncle.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Yes.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Well, I didn't.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
I knew you'd come back.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
And you're sure it was a woman?
The box. I need the box.
What do you mean?
Get out of the way.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Then why are you here?
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Who?
They were over here, Professor.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Son. About Rasputin --
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Sir, may I go first??
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Those things never work. Never.
Yup.
Whatcha looking at, John??
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
You're going alone?
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
What about you?
It's my lucky day.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
We've got such sights to show you --
Julia!
You remember.
No.
Help me.
Hurting.
Well?
Not know.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
It smells damp.
How long since you were here?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Larry!
How are you doing through there?
So damn stupid.
I'm here.
Maybe a brandy.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
I... suppose so, yes.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
Why don't you do the same?
Who brought me in here?
YOU'D like my room.
Call me tomorrow.
I love you, honey.
Really?
Finished?
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
What did I say?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Nice, Barry.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Yeah.
We can take your car.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Why would they care?
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
Isn't it?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
No way.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I have a television.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
On Clark Street!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
May I help you?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Yeah, sure...
Uh...yes, at the moment.
'Morning, Dick.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Let's not.
Rob.
It's Vince and Justin.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
Shit!
Are you coming home?
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I think you know that.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
I suppose so.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
It's me.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm sure.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
I guess I am.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Do you want me to be there?
What?
You know, with Ray...
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
Barry said its done.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
No.  Probably not.
Are you persuadable?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
What difference does it make?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Don't you like that?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Are you okay?
That way.
And after that?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Well we don't.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Nice.
You're the expert.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Grave robbers?
Jesus Christ.
Where?
What will you do now?
No.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
They do it each year.
It's beautiful.
A factor of age.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
What is it you want?
What's wrong?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Four?
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
All I need is for you to check the name.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
What are you doing man?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
You are the same?
I don't understand.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
But why be so concerned about me?
And you?
That is not me.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Oh please.  Another one.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Second musketeer.
We have no understanding.
Do not turn your back on me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
And have you something to settle with me?
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Run!
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Yes.
No.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
Same.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Oh, she was here.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.

You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Save that for the Tribune.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
No, I can't.
You've had a better offer, eh?
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What do you mean?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
How much do you want on it?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Ring that number, will you?
Don't open that!
Murder, uh?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
What!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
What?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Let's see the money.
You said it!
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
So have we!
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
What is it?
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Isn't that her picture?
How'd you get here, Earl?
They're not human!
But how do I know...?
Give him the you-know-what.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
They might be.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
We don't know anything about it
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
You know it? It must be an old one.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
Molly!
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
I agree.
What about R.J.?
Ma, Tiny's in.
Where's that?
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Can I help you with something?
You know... a couple of queers.
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
What!
Quiet.
What are you doing!
What I need are some answers. 
Come on, get with the facts.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
That kid is one horny retard.
That's nice.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Yeah?
I resign.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
Sorry.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
I um... no, I don't think so...
I don't know. I only saw one.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Who's your Daddy!
Yes, sir.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
I always favored the Hulk.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
You decide. Today is your day.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
What?
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
Progress!
Ouch. Yeah?
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
What do you mean?
My brother says he likes you, too.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Three foot one.
Please, honey, let me in.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Oh, Rosie.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
My God! The fork! The fork!
Boy, this is good!
You do?
You do?
Oh, and the sun block?
Flares?
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
You are an animal.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Huh?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
I'm ready.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
How much?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Okay?
Cut.
Thought you only drank milk.
What is?
I got drunk.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Fine.
Well, here it's half.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Maybe. You want to play?
You name it, we shoot it.
It's quiet.
How do you feel?
In the gut, I mean.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
HOW MUCH?!
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
When?
What time?
Yeah, sure has.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Try me.
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
Fair.
Do you always ask so many questions?
I used to be an actress.
You don't look like a college girl.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Fifth of scotch?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
No, why should I? It's yours.
What's this supposed to mean?
Give it back to me.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Well, he owns things.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You glad?
Well, what's so funny?
Leave now.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Yeah. That's right, too.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Game's over, Eddie.
You lived like this once.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Yes.
Yes.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What do you mean?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Hell of a night.
If we want it, it is.
Why, Dad?
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
I'm home now.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Mr. Gardner, I --
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I don't see anything.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What do you want?
You still believe in him.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
What're you talking about?
They don't know this.
Not listed, huh?
Thanks, Pops.
What the hell are you doing?
Get us out of here!
Any news on my wife?
And our forces?
How're we doing?
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Grey, you read me?
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Yes, I am.
Was his father stationed here?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
I shouldn't have left her.
Stop it.
I don't need it.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Here... now.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Marcus!  I did it!
Dad?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
What about you?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
The Ark of the Covenant.
My room!
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
What are you going to do?
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Don't call me that, please.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Rats?
They want my diary.
Look, can we discuss this later?
How did you she was a Nazi?
So did I.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Marcus would agree with me.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Where's my father?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
Hey, he's not a waiter...
India...
What?!
What?!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
What does the writing say?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
It's okay. You're all right now.
I want to go home...
No... they won't kill me.
Figures...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
My name is AL.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Who?
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Quit screwing around, this is important.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Too late...They want you.
JOE Or what?
You are CRAZY!
You gotta help.
Now what.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
What about it?
I can't do that.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
It's just not enough.
You'll be me.
Now what?
It's sand.
What? What do you mean?
.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
It is my business. It's my name.
What am I supposed to do?
What Happened?
She's got the most beautiful...s
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
One of your instincts?
It's him.
I've got an idea.
He hung us up dry.
And Dieter?
Dieter!
This may hurt.
Do something.
Now, you're too suspicious.
She is beautiful.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
Sorry...
What happened?
They have stolen state property.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
That name's familiar.
And how do you service foreigners.
It may have been affected.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Now you know what I know.
What?
Oh...and who is it!?
Let you leave without it.
What's so funny?
I waited for you.
...Naw. Made that up.
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
He didn't.
One chip?
Ryuji and Gruner.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
We figure out if it's in here.
Where what?
Chiang Cho?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Now what?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Just like that?
I knew it. I told him.
Why are you on to him?
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
It'l take months.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
Push it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
What the hell are you doing?
Debbie...
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Hi, baby.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Hardly new news.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
Yeah.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
You believe that?
Excuse me. Yeah...
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
You try and have a good time.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
A delivery device for nicotine.
Object to the form of the question!
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
No!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Grounds?
Why in God's name would I want...?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Yes?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Who was that?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
These are yours.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Why would you be here?
Gotcha.
He's passionate.
So I hear. Is that all?
To victory.
Screw you, asswipe!
No, we're not!
Friends?
Oh Miles!
You don't like me?
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
Comfy!
What do you want?
You can't prove anything.
Meaning my house.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
I fell in love Miles.
Wait! He works for YOU?
We are. And it's winding down.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
She did a Harriman.
Of Massey Myerson?
Maybe.
Shit.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Is this Ming?
Well, that's about to change big time.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Wait. I know you.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
I don't know. I can assume...
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wrigley!
Sorry.
What do you think?
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Miles.
Who's "Patty."
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me—those things give me a stiff pain.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
You're a peculiar chap.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
Who is he?
Fine man to fall in love with.
I'm sorry you read it.
Why should she? After all—
If you really mean it, I will.
We've done that already.
Amateurs!
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Here—
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
High time you got back.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Nope. No complaints.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
What's the matter?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Yeah.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Thought you were hungry!
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Oh, no!
Why not? I'm hungry.
Come on! come on! 
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
That's swell!
You bet I did.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
You bet we did.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
I've been thinking about you.
I said, the old man's screwy!
The dame's too smart for him.
Mr. Gordon—
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Mebbe.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Thanks. 
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Recall any names?
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Yeah, I guess you do.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
No, I did not.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Why Galveston?
Why?  What's wrong?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
That's our case!
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Aren't you being a little hard?
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
What's wrong, Lou?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Post Office.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Goddamn Sam!
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
...and your General?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
More than ten years.
How much more?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
That sounds fun.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
Won't forget?
Who?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
What'd ya mean?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
She wants to go back to work.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
What's in it?
How was your flight?
What's her name?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
If you're having some.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
Well, hello.
"American President"
Who was your girl before Annette?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
He tries to act cool.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
You're rationalizing.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Ray wants him.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Who's side are you on?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Who's the other one?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh-huh.
You said that the last time.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
What did you do after that?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
What were you two fighting about?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
Dreaming.
Jackie?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
A woman.
No, I give it to someone else first.
Uh-huh.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
It's boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.
Four days ago.
Want a Metrix?
Which one?
No.
You been to Japan?
Must of made quite an impression.
That sounds like a problem.
No.
Please.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
What are you doin'?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Whatcha watchin'?
I'm in my underwear.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
What does that mean?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
How long was she in there?
We went to the parking lot.
That's right.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Maybe the Feds got it.
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
You don't say.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
What does she do for you?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
You still there?
I'm alone.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
All I did was walk out with it.
In a way, yes.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
That I gotta see.
Turn left.
Where do you want to go?
Then what are you doing here?
It's all been a dream.
Stop!!!!
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
You need ... a doctor.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
... I've seen them, too.
Not me, buddy.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
You should go back to her.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Ah!
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
What's your name?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Whataya mean, no record?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Where is the lamp?
That help?
The room!
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where's Della? Bring her here?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
That's your decision.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Let go!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I want to know. You tell me!
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Bullshit!
I promise.
I love you when you're angry.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
Sit down!
WHO ARE YOU?
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
Just relax.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
You got a nice tan, though.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm sorry.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Nope.
What's wrong?
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
That black car?
He's not part of the program.
Goodbye old friend.
Can we blow it with just two?
What?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Creepy.
Kay-Em!
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Where is he?
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Rizzo, he's out there.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, you okay?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Rizzo, pull away!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
I...I don't know what I did...
I'm missing two!
Hurry! She's lost it!
I'm just saying.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Ow!
Sorry, sorry.
Azrael can you repeat that?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
What have you done?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Did you bring a check?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And incidental damages, if any...
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
I never saw one that big.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Be careful.
Where is he?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Who's that young man?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
What d'ya mean?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Florida license plate.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
I hope we get some more help.
What's that, a ship?
Quint...?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Do I set the goddam hook?
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
You're leaving?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
I'll drink to your leg.
What can that gun of yours do?
You know how I feel about her.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
I don't like Katrina.
Um, hi?
You're mad. Why are you mad?
I try really hard, actually...
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Nails? Really?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Uh, thanks.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Dad, no!
Or...
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
You're not listening to me.
Aw, please Junebug?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
You guys are playing music?
They're yellow.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
A hotel?
Adele for god sake please lis...
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
What?
...Yeah.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Carryin' a gun.
What?
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
What's your name, boy?
Where you from Walter?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Tight fit.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
What happened to Adele?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
A book on the warehouse murders?
Carrie.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Not yet.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Where's Adele?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
You were plenty hot.
...Diebold?
How old you?
Yes. Altogether.
Were they wearing condoms?
Yeah.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Yeah.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Telly.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Yep.
I hate this game.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Right.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Casper, where is he?
Na.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
No, Fidget, I...
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
How old are you?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Yeah.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
He still does.
I hate 'em.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Where does everyone sleep?
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
Morpheus.
What?
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
How'd you get in here?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
You got it on the board.
Then let's narrow it down.
Ready for round two?
Did anyone stand out?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Where is she?
Not really.
Why her?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
What is it, dad?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
No prints.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
About what?
Are you with the tournament?
Sounds very violent.
That's a very personal question.
She could be dead after the game.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
This isn't a game.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Let's change the subject.
No.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
Why?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
It was.
What is this?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Exactly.  It's the key.
Peter...
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
I'm sure you are.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I'm not nervous.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
You will go alone.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Yes.
The Beast will kill her.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
Use your sword.
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
Am I not worth returning to?
I ache with it.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
You've eaten nothing.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Sugarballs?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
Freylag's stronghold?
A fine match.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Do not try your trickery on me!
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Take...
Well, I don't need them...
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Rocket launcher.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I love you so much, Leon.
Poor darling, and then?
...Don't you drink?
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
...Yes.
Nothing, for the moment.
I don't know... Five minutes.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Who sent you?
Yes... Twice.
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Where?
I have new dreams now.
Maybe later.
What would you like us to do?
How long does this... Mania last?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Yes.
I do love you... very, very much.
You like to take walks?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
You've just decided, is that right?
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Where?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Is that right?
What happened?
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
What's your shoe size?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I really want that watch.
Hello.
Yes.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Don't you like me, Ben?
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
How are you doing?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Let's stay for a while.
Where are you staying?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Harvard Law School?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
What alibi?
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
It's so shameful...
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
What's going on?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Who's askin'?
Is everything okay?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
You can't even imagine.
What'd you do?
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
No.
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Licensed attorney or family member?
Name?
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Power yoga?
Josh proposed!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
You have Stromwell.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Are you asking me on a date?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Thanks for the backup.
Why do you say that?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
What?
Like some vile toadstool.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
East of Mercia?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Will you lead me to her?
The princess is dead.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Aye!  That too.
Beware.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
The wound is mortal.
Can you save her?
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Did you bring me here to sup?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
He'll not escape me.
A good day for singing...
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Dolt!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
A promise is a sacred oath.
A gentleman would offer water.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Are you honest?
What happened?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I thought you were dead... I --
What?
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Lili... I love you!
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
How do I get the horn back?
Dead, dead, dead.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
The fastest in the world.
Simple as that, eh?
Mom said I should.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Are you his friend?
No.
What's today?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
You should stay.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
A sink?
I'm good, thanks.
how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
He buys and sells the world.
Oh.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Thank you.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Why?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
A friend of yours is here.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I took some of your Vicodin.
What are you now?
I wish you had told me then.
I gave up on you.
I would have killed him.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
She's a little sad, is all.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Where have you been for a week?!
Where will you live?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
I drove over and you were gone.
Last time you were gone for a week!
What have you been before today?
Do you remember?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I thought we were helping.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I'm married.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
That's the problem.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Yes, it is.
Nagger?
She's doing just fine.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
I'm talking about a haircut.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Is Spanky here?
Want me to come back some other time?
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
You know I trust you, Claude.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Don't I know you?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Still got that ten dollars?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
This fork is filthy.
What does that mean?
I said you're soft.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Go where, Ray?
Don't make me take them away from you.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
You didn't get ketchup?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
You ever done time before?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
I can't take that, mama.
They gave me life, mama.
Is everyone here?
I prefer bourbon.
What's going on here?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Apparently, your sister died.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What's your name?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Now will you get in the flask?
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
What is it?
Makin' friends already.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
You came through, Nicky.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Easy, Liberace.
Should we wake him up?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
"Octopus people?"
School?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
..."The Devil?"...
Yes. What is rent?
Hey...
See something you like, my man?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
All right -- what are you?
Where do you think we came from?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
You prefer women?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Later.
I changed my mind.
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
You could have called me yourself.
Why tell me?
I don't have much time.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
But what is this -- why?
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
They won't believe us.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
What's that?
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't!
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
You know, Jessica.
What kind of jewel is this?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
We'll have to bury him.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Yes...
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
You're not contagious are you?
Good... You up for a drive?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
We'll keep a watch on the house.
His or ours?
Andy?
Set.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
I don't. I don't know him.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Do you remember?
I won't ever tailgate.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
My... My head.
What's that?
A videotape.
Called? When?
We've got to call the police.
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Let's go home.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
At sixty?
Suit yourself, champ.
I was?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Fossils.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
I see.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
The police?
Yeah. You know.
It's unbelievable.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Cave, eh? Where?
Leaving?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Goodness, no!
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Oh, good heavens, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
When was all this?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Charming, isn't she?
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Yes.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Yes.
Hurray!
Do try to sleep, Bob.
He's dead.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Did I say "if"?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
You say the porters are waiting for us?
What was that?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
Good.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I guess we're in for it.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
What do you want him to do?
How about you? Do you want to go?
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Actually, sir--
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Ha ha.  No, really.
What?
Looks like a train ticket.
What's going on, Kay?
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Since how long?
Do his job.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Goodwill...
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Actually, I don't know...
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Wally!
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Drop some money.
I can't.  I have to know.
Who wanted her little girl back?
You don't remember me, do you?
From where?  D.C.?
You made those tapes...
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Tell me not to worry, John.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
I go running down there.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
And who the hell is that?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
John --
You're kidding, that's today?
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Did he close the front door?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
But you call this room the "temple".
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Are these all of her previsions?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Are you reading my mind right now?
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
Okay... now let me time you.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Come on!
I forgive you...
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
You're not gonna kill me?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
What about the picture --
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
What's so funny?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Not if I stay away from him.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
The system would collapse.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
You said they're destroyed.
Who?
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sean --
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Tell him not now.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
We can stop him.
John Anderton was my friend!
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Howard --
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
We used to, every summer.
I don't have any sugar either.
But John was with him at the pool?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
You know I need to use you.
They've never been separated before.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
So?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Women?
We used to take baths together.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
No.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Ho's a good guy --
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
Yes.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
No. Just the cross streets.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
It's not losing record.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Yeah. I know the number.
I know the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
We need guns.
You wanna go right now?
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Who's driving her?
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
What exactly did they say?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Like I said, I don't know.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
What the hell did you do?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
We're getting whacked.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Let's check out the penguins.
The what?
Did you hear what he just said?
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty bucks?!?
You did?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Bobby and Ricky.
You want to come splash around.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Where's Spa.
'Strapped?'
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Does anyone want another?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Come, now. You just got here.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Sure. You boys want anything?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
We're going to New York?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Who's gonna outfit us?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Scotland.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
I'm working on it.
It hit?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
I can't make out that shit.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
What have you set your mind to?
I'm in Detroit.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Let some of us come down there.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Yes, sir, I did.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Did you hear me?!
Another one?
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
I'm the man.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
So you are going to talk me to death.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Why?]
[How does it work?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[How much do you want?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[And?]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So how's business?
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Potential? I don't understand.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I don't understand.
No.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
Our child's safety is at stake.
I think it's fantastic.
Hmm?
He has to go, Samuel.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[Who's that?]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
Please...
I'll wait for your call.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'll see you around.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure. This girl said...
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
He coming home right now.
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
What are you going to do with him?
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
So long, Ho-Jon.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
The chest-cutter.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
When?
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Frank...
A football game?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
You betcher ass, Dad.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
What for?
Black capsule.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Is he out?
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
What do we do?
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
That's right. We work well together.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
It's possible
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
It isn't always this rough?
Ayuh.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Why would he do that?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
The one and only.
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
About that chest-cutter...
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Are you all right?
Who?
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Did you write this?
A third party?
That's good.
The Websters!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
John Doe.
Who, for instance?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Hurry up, Pop.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Had any schooling?
I used to pitch.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Go out and find her!
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
The heelots!
No!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Nineteen!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
What?
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
SWAT wants to go in.
I don't know.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Where's the stereo?
What happened? Is there a problem?
Tell my dad.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
...a car.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Anything on Korda so far?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
For now that's all.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
You can't kill me like this.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
I've rarely shot anyone.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
You think you can learn, McCall?
No.
Yes.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
How much you wanna bet?
What the fuck is going on.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Hey.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
You like this place?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Your concern is heartwarming.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
You let us worry about that.
I'll provide you with transportation.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
What do you want?
Do you believe in miracles?
It's all here...
What's happening?
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
What about the customers with reservations?
The maze has been changed --
Who?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Where?
Cleaning up a mess.
You went to my high-school?
It was a test.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
This.  No point to it.
It was just there.
Access established.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
We've got him locked!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
What?!
Wow.  Sand.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
I see... a fox
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
NEW POWER COINS!!
I'm in!
Hey, boss!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Simon says...
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Anybody see them?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Boo-Boo.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
So what happened?
I guess I am. Just a little.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
He was around...
How's Bugsy doin'?
Well...
Something came up.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
It'll just be a few minutes.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
He's an animal!
I don't fuck my partners.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Guess I'm just lucky.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Can't you give it to me later?
Who?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Hypnos?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Stu...Stu...
I just need to use the phone, lady.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
I'm good.
You know ...  ... whoops!
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Mother!
Mm hmm.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Really?
What happened?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Are you sure you got my bag in?
And where is she?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
But it *isn't*?
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
What dame?
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Yeah.
Is the wind tired out there?
Why me?
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Otis!
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Aw--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Than what?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
It does!
Mr. President--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
What is it?
*No*!
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Good. Where are we?
Calendar?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
*This* is.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
On paper?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Have I?
Why?
Letitia.
No--
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Saunders--!
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Hurray!
Sure.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
I'm splendid, too.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
"So help me God."
How's that, buddy?
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
That's right.
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
That's him. Let him in.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Order!
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
They think he's pixilated.
He sure is pixilated.
Are you married?
Yes, sir.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
What?
Have you seen the papers?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
What did he play?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Let's just walk, okay?
People have been crucified before.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Huh?
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
Yes.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.
Oh, yes sir.
Stuff, sir?
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Must we have the echo?
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
You can't?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
That's funny. Why is that?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
South Dakota north.
Yeah. What?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Prairie? Oysters?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh, I do too, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
But she's on the telephone—
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
What's that?
But you do therapy?
What are you doing for lunch?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
A little.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
What?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
Why do you watch?
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Sure.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
You're good.
We're going for a walk.
Well, look who's here...
What would you do?
Sore throat?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Um-huh.
Transference!
...How violated I feel?
But...
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What'd he say?
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
Nah... scotch.
Is that the question?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Don't you like this?
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
You don't think I'm insane?
It's not?
I can tell you anything else.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Sorry...
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
Oh yes, of course.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
Where's your new friend?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Where are they taking him?
Proceed!
What are you doing here?
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
You swear?
You know your history.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
I think you were jealous
Got it!
Got guts, lady.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
That looked rather painful.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
I thought you were done?
Do I?
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
Sounds good to me.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Ummm.
Superheroes.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
You're dead.
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
Hi.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Yeah.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
We had an off night, that's all.
Are you coming or not?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Agents?
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Jeffrey!
And a social life.
That was too close.
Through there!
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
What do you think Napoleon will do?
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Read it back.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Yes, sir, I am.
I haven't been there for three years.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
And he sent you to me?
I very much doubt that he will.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
No...
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Well, you shall see.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Were you in love with any of them?
I cannot promise you that.
I will never forgive you.
Promise.
I know what you're doing in there.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Five minutes.
Separate bedrooms?
I believe you sent for me.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Does she deserve anything better?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
What I am talking about is moderation.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Come in.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
Y'all never use it?
Stretch it out.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What's crackin'?
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Who is that?
That's the sister.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You go first.
No.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
You did all this for me?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
You alright?
Here I come!
You too.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I do.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
What's the matter?
What you doing to my nephew?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
'S okay. What do you think?
That's...a comfort to hear.
You were very nervous.
What?
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Yes, yes, I understand.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
You're out of your mind.
I want'to talk to her.
I think you better put that away.
Ready?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
No...kisses to you.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Please...
That's right.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
I don't know.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Hey!
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
When'll the skiff be ready?
No.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Who?
Bluebeard!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
There's something else.
You go set down by the River.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
What!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Hing, hang, hung.
Hm?
It's all here.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Mm-hm.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
John's bad.
I'm hungry.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Can I have milk too?
I was praying.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
She took them kids with her?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What do you want?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Hello?
My dream.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What?
You don't know he did it.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
It wasn't that serious...
Did you sleep?
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
You feel better now, right?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Capitalistic methods...
Misha! Misha!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Good evening, Gaston.
What time have you, Gaston?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
Leon, my little boy.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Allow me, Comrade.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
...and Kopalski.
Private.
But you had!
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Can I help you?
Love to.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
Wounded? How?
Glorious, analytical...
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
Then you should go back to your table.
You remember this room?
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Anything, Ninotchka.
I don't think so.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Let's turn on the radio.
Radio! What is radio?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now, Swana...
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
No.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
No thanks, Swana.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
We have nothing to discuss.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
May I have your bags, madame?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
My jewels?!
You did say it, sir.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
We'll see about that ...
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Pay him.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
Sorry ...
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
That's what they're doing.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
The army?
I know it well, sir.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
That fruitcake!  What about him?
Just do what I say, Bob.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
You never told him?
What?
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
I believe you're right, boss.
Sir?
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
... little Bobby.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
The White House.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
So, what's this about, Dick?
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
What do you mean, Jack?
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
That'll be the day.
Uh, wait ...
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
... give me a break, Mary.
But it was all we had.
Where you from?
I like jazz ...
What's in there?
It makes us human ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
Amen to that.
Are you serious?
Were you planning to tell me?
Anything.
I've missed you.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Yes.
Tomorrow.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Some say you are, Rocky.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Want a cup?
How fresh is this coffee?
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
Nothin'?
Carla Jean...
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
We goin' in?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Wasn't no bullet?
Yessir. Wasn't none.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Okay.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I thought it was a car afire.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
...Be careful.
Okay.
...How'd you sleep?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well I didn't see it.
Yeah.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
You know what's goin' on?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Yes I did.
Where does he work?
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Sir?
You live in that house behind the store?
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
Sir?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
What about one forty-two.
No, one forty-two.
Then you'll like me.
I know how he found me.
Yes.
I didn't say braze.
What product.
I don't know.
No sir.
Are you in the service?
What outfit.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Sheriff, I don't...
No, Elden, I need to...
Yeah?
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Little place called "Williams," why?
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
That's my son! My son is dead!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Ad lib?
So, call me when you --
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
What're you doing here, Roy?
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
That's horrible!
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
It's something I had to do. For David.
I got this apartment with a guy.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Rosa...
Rosa, so you've met David?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
If we're for real?
Could you give us an example?
I... I don't know...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Hell of a way to die.
You told me how to do it!
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Worse... you're in Texas.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
How'd they describe her?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I never said that I believed...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Seems like a nice place.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I don't know, George...
What the hell's going on?
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Her show?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
...Pete?
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Whuhh...
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Helluva idea.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's not my ring.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
The preacher said it absolved us.
A million dollars.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
What's your name, boy?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
I want to fly jets, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Yes I do!
Something tells me you've been here before.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
You what?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Sid, there's no baby.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Lynette, where's Sid?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
You got a girl?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
There's always a choice.
You stayed after all.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm looking for Sid.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Hey, you guys still awake?
That isn't true, is it?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
But she expects you to marry her?
Sid, what happened?
You're welcome.
Me.  I am.
Bullshit.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Pure idiot.
They're coughing.
And we're never getting in.
'Bout four o'clock.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Well, I know that now.
The crowd goes wild.
What do we do?
Nope.
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What are you doing?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Alma I told you to...
No...
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Hey... what the hell you doing?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
I don't know. Look around man.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Can you make a deal with them?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Rodgers... this is no good...
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
We need money first...
C'mon let's...
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Yeah.
Yeah... let me think about it.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Yeah, I do.
Maybe...
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
What's up with you?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Rose?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Yes, sir.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Very well, proceed, sir.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
How can we end this madness?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Is it?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I stand corrected.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Gabriel.
When?
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Your son, what did you name him?
For what?
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Not yet, Thomas.
Seventeen.
Father... I killed those men...
Honey, Church will be fine.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
But don't you dare say that.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
I don't get it.
I'm not tired!
I'm sure you're not.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Does she love the cat?
It's funny, all right.
You keep saying that.
Why? For God's sake, why?
What did we do, Jud?
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
She's finally asleep.
You better get going, hon.
You stole my boat.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
I'm glad we got here in time.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
You would do that?
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Where does it make berth?
I can get you out of here.
Not without my effects.
'Bootstrap?'
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen it?
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
He's still breathing.
No.  She hasn't.
A moment.
But --
How long do you leave him in there?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
She says it's not.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Consideration?
Poppy, please --
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Somebody has to.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
Nothing really worthwhile.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
... just like the mouse.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Yes.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What do these replicators do to people?
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Just look at it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
You made this out of my hair?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
May I use your telephone?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Oh, Mother!
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
Gallagher!
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
That's ridiculous.
Yale '21, I believe.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Is that so?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
It's the smoke.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
My mistake - she's glaring.
Been where?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Right.
Yeah?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
A statement? Good.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Hello, Smith.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Sure.
And you struck him right here in our house—?
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
What do you mean?
No. I want to know.
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Wait.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
I told you, George. I'm not going.
But where would we go?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
I'm busy.
Okay, that's IT!!!
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
I think I've got something to say.
It's like the basketball team.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
I don't know.
We're supposed to be in school.
You know him?
Owns the hardware store.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Jen, listen ...
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Well if I don't who will?
Me too. Sounds swell.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
You got the admissions letter.
That was sure swell ...
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
You're gonna forget about me.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
What the hell's going on!
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
What do you mean?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I had nothing to do with that.
No you're not.
OW!
Hope you're proud of yourself.
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
What?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Forget about that!
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
TV repair?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Cool.
So you can't talk to me?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
That's your fault not mine.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
You just said very food.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
No.
I feel really on the spot now.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Nothing.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Are you watching a porno movie?
Really?
No.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
So you think you can?
No. I'm sorry.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is not cool.
Not very well.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Hi.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Do you want to pick me up?
Yeah.
Ok.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see?
Is everything ok?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Did something happen; are you alright?
...yes I did...?
Oh that's great.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
This is Lena.
Really?
Yeah.
About six months ago. Why?
Yeah......yeah.....
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
...what...?
Where do you have to go?
Yes I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Why?
It's ok, take your time.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
Can we agree that that is that?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Yes I'm fine.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Hi, Lance.
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
What happened?
Where you been?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Please don't do this.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
What are you doing?
I know.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
I don't really remember that.
Your expenses are your own.
Hello?
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Ok.
So...did my brother call you?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Enough to discern its tenor.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
He can't do that to me.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
-- water! --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
An innocent child is dead.
AND DID YOU?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Of course.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
And place my reputation at stake?
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
What have they done to you now?
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
Leave at once --
Very much.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
That poor woman.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
So I've been told.
Louis
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
Not for me.
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Sir?
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Forget it-
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
But with compassion and insight--
Yes.
Please don't say this.
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
I expected more from you.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Hedy Lamarr?
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
For Christ's sake, shut up--
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
No, we're jake. But listen-
I think you better sit down
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
And where you goin'?
Who's that?
Whadda you care?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
You know, like bang her or anything?
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
At night?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Come over here.
I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
What?
Yeah, what?
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Jefferies?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
By the way  what happened to your leg?
-- until yesterday morning.
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
You think he's getting out of here?
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I can't. The police have it by now.
I knew it!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
He and his wife splitting up?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Goodnight, you idiot.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Big enough?
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I'll rephrase the question.
Do you like it?
What for?
Phone number?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You still want to go home, Moose?
You can't protect me.
That's funny!
You awake?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
See?  It stopped.
Hi.
I know.  That's why I came back.
You scared?
Who's that!
Yeah?
Hey where'd you go?
What?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Plato?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
How!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Get lost.
And your folks didn't understand?
If he could--
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
You cold?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Sure.  Lots of times.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
You disappointed?
It is for me too.
Plato, where's your father now?
Are you and Mom home tonight?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
Don't hurt him...
Gabriel, you promised!
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Toys for... adults?
No, no --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No, c'mon --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Where the hell are you going?
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
We could live it up and --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
What the fuck is going on.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Gabriel!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
He wants to see your map.
I'm almost done.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
They all are. Football's on.
What?
You... you don't know me --
No, you can't --
Put him in the truck.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Yes!
Yes!
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Bam Bam.
I said, who the hell made the map?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
They won't recognize me.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Don't tip.
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
You gotta be kidding me.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
What... Powwow...
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Cancer-sucker.
How long ago was your makeover?
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Don't move, Rudy!
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
And you set me up.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
But... I had a five...
What? No...
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Daddy, did ya see that?
We can work this out, can't we?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Didja use the commode story?
I can do that.
Tell me more about Cabot.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Just hold on buddy boy.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Mr. Blue's dead?
What's that?
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't tip.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
What happened?
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
No real people?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Nope.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Of course.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
So that was why she tried to run away.
Hold on.
I suppose it is.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Tell me, darling.
All my clothes --
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
That's right, Steve.
You know what she asked me?
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
Is that the only reason you came back?
All right, you didn't know.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
I said I didn't care.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
But I want to stay.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
What comes after Z?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
But you're his brother.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
I found a picture of his wife.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Alex, what are you doing?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Hey, you left your book back there.
He's here.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
This can't be happening?
What the hell are you doing?
Father!
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Let me see the files.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
You're not wearing a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
I'm so glad you're here.
Father.
BLOOD FEAST!
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
Here we go again.
MURDERED?!!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Carl's a jerk!
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
You mean for TV or print?
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You bring me such peace...
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
"P" as in...
Objection! Argumentative!
Who is this?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Who wants fruit salad?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
What is it, Betty?
I'll take this instead.
Yeah —- sure.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
You scared?
Let's get out of here.
We can't stand here all night.
No.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I'll give you a check.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I did her hair.
And that was all?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Why?
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
I'd like that.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
I don't know.
What's that?
Why wait?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
I'm at sea, Jason.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
What's wrong, Mary?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I never thought you did.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm afraid not.
I'll be out in a minute.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
False alarm.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Why'd you drop out?
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
What's the first?
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Kids? What about them?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Ann. Hello.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
About sex?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What do you have to do to get ready?
No.
No.
On tape?
Don't you get lonely?
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Interesting analogy.
I'm not in love with you.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I can't tell you like this.
John?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Are you having an affair?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Why don't I believe you?
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Goddam right.
Bastard...
What do you mean?
Yeah, so?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I hate my sister.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Do you have to say that?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I wonder why.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
What kinds of questions?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
I was just trying to --
So what's my share of the dress?
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
She still is.
Nope.
Nothing.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
Whichever you prefer.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
No.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I've got to get back to the office.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Hello.
Cynthia. John.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
You told Ann about this?
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Who?
Graham.
I know. Will you please leave now?
No.  You said three-fifty?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Brian Kirkland, please.
John Millaney.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Hi. Want a drink?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
What happened?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Gonna cut me open?
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Yes?
Yes?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Out of self comes selflessness.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
I'm not going, Janet.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
It's...
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
You shouldn't have said that.
I NEED SOME
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
F for...
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Say, is Maya working?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Two years ago, buddy.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Highliner, please.
You said you had it all lined up.
Yeah, Conundrum.
And?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Let me call Christine.
Are you chewing gum?
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
With Maya?
So what should I wear?
Aye-aye, captain.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Later.
What the fuck are you doing?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
We gotta go back.
The plan is... you go.
Yep. Quite a day.
Look at this!
Why don't you come in?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Hi.
Hey.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
How long have you been into wine?
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Yeah? Like what?
Got it.
Good. So did I.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Ken.
That's great.
I am.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
See you over there, Miles.
Huh.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
I'm here.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
No I'm not.
I cursed.
Yes.
It's getting stronger.
It needs batteries.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
What about Isabelle?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.  So he was tall?
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
Why not?
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
I didn't know you were out.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Where is Rae?
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
The jury saw it differently.
What makes you think I could?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
I've given that up.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
What's this?
Where's the dog now?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Okay -- for you.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
You're not renewing my contract.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Why isn't she with you?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Excuse me?  Start?
My two favorite girls.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Do what you do to Simone.
No, I'm okay.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Absolutely not!
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
What's that?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
She still with Kent?
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
One thing bothered me.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Really?  Too bad.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
No, that was me.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
The background is.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
You're in breach.
Taller, Viktor.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Thank you.  It's not important.
Let's take it down a notch.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Are you calling me?
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
You mean aneurysm.
Where should I look then, Cole?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
That isn't magic.
I didn't know you were funny.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
What?
Cats?
I told you what I want.
When?
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Are you wigging out?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Don't go home, okay?
Lots of things.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
They did?
You can see her?
Dead people?
...I don't know.
Cole, please stop.
Yes, Cole?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Chuck E. who?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
What are you talking about?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Aha. The Lovers.
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Are you crazy?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
This is his room... isn't it?
People say he was a murderer.
Amends...?
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Throw me one.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Down boy.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
How does it feel, Keith?
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
...no... Mac... p-please...
I almost thought for a second...
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, we need to talk!
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
It's my nature.
Where are you?!
What?
Shelby --
All the rib eyes?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I'll get if for you.
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Where'd he go?
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
An existentialist.
A what?
You have a great profile.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Seriously?!?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
You know this guy, don't you?
Yeah.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
What kind of a guy is he?
Order up!
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
What does the old Timex say?
Do I have a choice?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Go head on, breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Where the hell are you?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh.
Anything on the Swede?
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Man, that's great.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
What happened?
FUCK YOU!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
... Jesus... what for?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Shoot.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
That's fantastic.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Is there anybody else here?
Why, who did you see?
Who was it?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
My wife.
I love her.
Rheya.  Not here.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
What's wrong.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Thank you.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
I never said I didn't.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I wish you wouldn't.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
Am I really her?
Uh...
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
What did he say?
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
Claire?
Hmm...
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
What's to like?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Not exactly.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Oh that thing in Queens.
Do you dance?
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
Nothing.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
You got no idea...
Honey.  You got him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
Bought it.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
What're you talking about --
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
At my house...!
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
No, I will not step outside.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Watch your step!
How about dinner tonight?
She's taking singing lessons.
I don't think she can sing, either.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Harry…
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Now tell me you love me.
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
How much do you know about it?
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
So they're airing this tonight?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Sefton!
Yeah.
What is your number?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Jawohl.
Why do you do this to me every morning?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Let me go!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You did?
What do they always say?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Let me alone.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Betty! Betty!
You want to go?
Not yet.
What are you going to do?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Right.
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Yeah?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
What did you say?
Which one of us is the informer?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Good morning, Sefton.
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Is it all right if we smell it?
It's working.
He is.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
All of us.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Better?
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
A photon torpedo?
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
No, I didn't know that.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
David... Sorry I'm late.
David, I don't understand...
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
None that I can detect, sir.
I know you... Do I not?
Yes, yes, Spock...
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
About a dozen officers and men.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Genesis, I want it.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
David. Please.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
What?
How soon --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
I didn't expect anything.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
The word is given: warp speed.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
What's she doing here?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
Affirmative, Admiral.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
That's it?
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Khan!
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
All stop, sir.
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Stop engines.
I can't get power, sir!
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
An experimental device, doctor.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
The top of what?
My name?
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Implicitly.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
Where could you take them?
All right. The truth?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
So. There we are.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Steady, now. We need your help.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You tricked me.
... What does that mean?
Explain.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
No power to the bay doors.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Well, that's different.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Sulu Hikaru.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
Don't panic...
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
For what purpose?
Data doesn't breathe.
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
A ship,
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
I don't think they believe us.
Worf, you must hurry...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Why was Data assigned?
What...?
No children?
Or you could try lying down.
... I believe you...
All hands. Battle stations!
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
No. I will not betray my friends.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Can you configure it?
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
What did you do to the batteries?
How serious is the damage?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Always am.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Their com system must still be down.
Active.
Ready.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Where in the States?
California. San Francisco.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
What do you want?
Cochrane?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
No. It's a lot further than that.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
Right.
Report.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Even Data?
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Uh, Jim...
You feign ignorance?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Well, I -
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
And your coat.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Who is "US?"
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
According to my information, today.
What is it?
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
A lie?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
You having hearing problems, mister?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
And if they're still in place?
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Can you remember our father?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
I do not understand.
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
Indefinitely.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
What do you imagine this is?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
If you wouldn't mind.
May I have this dance?
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
What programs were accessed?
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
Not with the Romulans.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
No!
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Thank you, sir...
Why don't they answer our hails?
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
Why am I here?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
We are.
Long ago.
Please.
Report!
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
I'll take that.
I understand.
I make maps.
No.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
When can we expect containment?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
No deal.
George... Do you hear me, George?
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Please...
Please...
Gear shift.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Which way?
Pancakes.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Go.
What?
Space?
You. Mouth closed.
Money.
You want to try it?
It was yellow.
Yes.
Eh... yes...
You want this ticket?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Can I have the gun?
The captain...
It's bad.
Are you my friend?
I do not want to.
Put that back.
I must meet my ship.
I feel better if I move.
Good morning.
But...
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
How long will it take you to get home?
The yellow one.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Call the police!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Twenty-eight years.
It was a man though... right?
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
I made my choice, Lenny.
Fuck you.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Sounds good.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Naw.  She won't call me.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
He records himself raping and killing her--
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Naawww.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
What clip?  What was it?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Nero.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
What's his name?
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Tell me.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I guess.
You never told me.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Besides that.
No.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Hey, Sheriff.
What does the Manager say?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Hi there.
You have the body?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
I've been looking for you.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
What?
We have another one.
Another what?
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
Why did you go to Chicago?
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
They're all criminals?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
I know.
He's called a couple times.
You mean --
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
And nobody else can do that?
What's up?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
You were right. He found me.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Unlock these cuffs.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Is he dead?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Speck is dead.
But why attack an Agent?
How far is Amarillo?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Shit.
You should call your Grandmother.
What do you drive?
...maybe...
Hi.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Always...
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Are you on the other line?
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
There's the rub.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Oh.  Where is this place?
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
There are so many beautiful women here.
It's unbelievable.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
What's the point?
Well, that's dumb.
They turned you down?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
What's he do?
Not well.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
That's right.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
You're crazy.
What?
Wake up, baby.
Whu?
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
What an asshole.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
...gotta...
No, baby. You're money.
She thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Selling scrap metal.
I hear she's getting real fat.
You guys are such assholes.
Yeah. You met him once.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
She didn't see.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
So, two days?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
...shivering...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
What was that?
The food is on the table.
Eat it, it's on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
Are you worried about security for your million?
You take care of your family?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
Is it necessary?
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
No, I wanted other things for you.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
Hey, beautiful girls!
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
What was that?
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
What?
Send some bodyguards.
We're going to New Jersey?
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
I think so.  Detective squad?
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Who's this?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
What? What's this?
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
Good afternoon!
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
No! I've got more than one shirt!
I didn't mean with you in it.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Is Freddie here?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Ripley's plans.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Dickie?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Mr Greenleaf.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Such as?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I hope she never knows.
What about Cortina?
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
What?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
What?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Will we see you later?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Ten thirty?
What rumour?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was that Meredith?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
No!
Absolutely.
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
You want to canvass?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Huh?
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Damn.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
More people watch it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
No, why?
Try holding the match like this.
This is gotta be a game, right?
Oh, are you all right?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Is he Italian?
He's Black, OK?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Well... I guess so.
That's a nice name.
Well, you want to or not?
Where?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
He shoots dope too.
What's so important?
I sure hate to go alone...
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
You want to work uptown nights?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
So I hear.
Is that so?
Anything you say, officer.
Wha -- ?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
I know.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Had a close one.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
What are you doing?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
We were in love... weren't we?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Now, did you remember that, or...
Your dancing's very good.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
I do.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
But I...
Ernie.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Yes.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
You kids off to the dance?
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
I know.  A Purple Heart.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
I taught you that.
Found me.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Would you like some brandy?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
What do you mean?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Cathy!
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Don't you like us?
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Do you know him?
Yes, but where?
And the white house?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Yes?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Young woman cut herself.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
Whose side are you on?
And certainly pretty.
How long have you known her?
When?
Then he saw.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Monday?
I wonder if you could help me.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
What are you? A policeman?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Why... 
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Oh, no you don't!
He was watching a ball game on television.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
So you didn't go to school together.
You were lying.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
What'll it say?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
No, no...
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
Santa Rosa?
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Do you have any lovebirds?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
What were the crows after at the school?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
How do you plan to do that?
Then let's go. Now!
But can't you give me any idea?
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
Well? And are you not a good student?
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
No.
You've no thought of going there?
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
I would make you rich.
Was the paralysis immediate?
Nearly a year.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You sent them. I had no choice.
You lied at my trial.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What did they give you?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
I heard you were looking for this.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Your father gave them to both of you.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You mean Alex.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
Look, can I just call a cab?
It still doesn't mean...
No.
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
He'll be there at 8:30.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
What does that mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
The present situation?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
It was a wonderful day.
You ready?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
How do you know?
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I feel different right now.
Naturally I think so.
Oh -- hello--
What is it you want?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Why not?
It must be twelve-thirty.
Who?
Hello.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
How long will that take?
Yeah.
We don't ride with vampires.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
What?...
What's that smell!?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
No.  Just you.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
See you later.
Smells like something died.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Does it burn?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Okay.  Talk.
Star.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Me, too.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
When?
Do I have to do this?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
What's the matter?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Somebody broke in.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
After all this mess then.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
He might just wait us out.
Then we go after him.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
So what do you make of it?
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
MacReady...?
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
On the towers?
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
When was his mother taken?
Why did they built it?
What do you mean?
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Why?
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
All right, what is it now?
I know it's not a diamond but --
Holding you... again.
All right...
We took a walk three days ago.
In the future, we'll be better.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
I live with it every minute of every day.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Mara...?
It was different then.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
May I get you some --
I did...
"Eloi"?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I am the oldest.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Yes, sir.
We'll see about that.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
And what does that mean?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
How did you come to know their names?
I don't understand...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Do I know you from somewhere?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
We're late.
Why?
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
What?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
They're not here.
What? What are you thinking?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I've been ok.
Good. How's your mom?
How you doin'?
My God you look exactly like him.
[Beat] I don't know.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
What do you mean?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
And how do you know that?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Don't you go to jail for that?
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
It's gonna be sticky.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
Becker does? Are you sure?
Where are you going?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, how'd you get here?
I'll manage.
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
You don't think that's crazy?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Hon.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Tell us about him.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
What the fuck is going on?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Can't it go to any office?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Yes.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Louise.  Where are we going?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Which part?
I wish we could've brought him with us.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Before.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
What?!
What?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Then let's not get caught.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Hi there!  You alright?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Gay? He said you were gay?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Never?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Jesus Christ you're right.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Healy you dog!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
I work with retards.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
And it doesn't cramp your style?
A fucking moron.
I guess.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Urrggghh...
You want her dead, don't you?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I think your life's about to change.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That must make it tough.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
How do you guarantee that?
No I'm not.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Holy shit...
Magda!
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
What's up?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
So who you taking to the prom?
Hey.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Get over here.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Well, I'm not.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
And?
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Yes it is.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Hey, sport. You winning?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Bob?
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Mr. Clear Moon.
James Looks Twice?
What's this about?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
-- did you understand me when I said that --
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Who is he?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Thanks, Cooch.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Jesus, you alright?
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
What did he say?
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
That's not solid.
Ray --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
1868...
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
So they took care of Leo.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Two.
The what?
It never came up.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
I can't.
How about what?
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You're totally insane.
Come on.
Well no...inverse order.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
No.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
I sit. I think. I play games.
Off me or off you?
One more.
Remember one thing.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
You're crazy. We're level.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Like what?
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
So I've heard.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
What?
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
GET LOST!
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I guess I owe you one.
We did it.
Figured it out yet?
I think I can work it out on my own.
Helping him in.
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
For the same reason you are.
I called your house.
Or you can quit.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
I'm nothing like him.
Not something they tell dependents.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Fuck you.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
No, sir.
But I thought...
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Eight years.
What do you want?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
On his way.
Shit!
They sell fake memories.
I don't know.  Maybe.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Shit!
Look at this shit.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Is that better?
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
You went to those brain butchers?!
Oh God, Doug.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
No options.
Go on.
Why would I lie to you?
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Aliens built it.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Jeez, look at that guy.
You're hung up again.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Prairie dog burrow...
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Well, folks, what's the plan?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Watch your ass, shithead.
How's she doing?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Burt!  Heather!
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
I brought it... to the coroner.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
I have to talk to your brother.
Don't hurt him.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Objection.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
I can describe it.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
You're doing a murder case?
I embroidered.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
'lo, Cecil.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
What do you want?
Yeah, we do some of that.
And why was an exception made?
The phone company was broken up.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
And no one found the ring?
He didn't suffer.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Accidental?
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
When?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
You want a muffin?
Laura, I am your friend.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
It does matter. We're in love.
What about tonight?
See what?
Eating?
Josie, I think we should go public.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Fine.
We're late to get to your mother.
Did you come home during the day last week?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
The man's an ambulance chaser...
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
Yes.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
It looks that way.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I... yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
I do. Yes.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I know of him.
How is that?
What book is that?
Huh!
Say it.
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
That's what I'd planned to...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
'Code Blue'...
Dr. Gruber...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
...and you're going to do that?
You live in the neighborhood?
Kathy Price...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Yes. It was, actually.
Yes.
I... do you want me to leave?
Is there going to be a later...?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
It's over!
No... no...
Thank you.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Hello, I'm calling from...
Yes. Price...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...fifty thousand dollars?
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Uh...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...I'm going to need your help...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
...Gruber's not bad.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
That's right.
Yeah. I'm awake.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
What happened in those three...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
It's always been a good persuader.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Must be somebody in there.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
No, you don't.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
no.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Your bed?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
You okay?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
You're not crazy, by the way.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
I've never mentioned it to him.
Yes.
Heather, what is it?
What's that?
Me?  Why me?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Why did we begin this?
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Come in.
Yes sir.
Gieg, Chuck.
She isn't that old.
Feels different doesn't it?
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Hey, shut up will ya?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
That's how he died you know.
I can't go in there.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
How long you been standing there?
No, sir.
I'm sorry...
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
Yes, that's true.
Yes.
I understand.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
I'm from all over.
No, haven't heard of it.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
What's that?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Forty bucks...
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
No sir...
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Why not? How was the fishin'?
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
You won't of missed much.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Here she goes again...
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
What happened to him?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Come look at this.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
It's just another case, Sailor.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Uh huh.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
How'd you know my daddy?
You upset with me?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
So where'd you say you was?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
You must be my son.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
That's not why I called.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Just tell me what you want.
Where? In the leg?
No.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
I didn't see nothin'...
Well?...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Thank you.
Emily?
She's still a transvestite.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
No. Not yet he isn't.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Tripp?!
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Such as.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
No...
I'll be... somewhere else.
You must be mistaken.
How long have you been having them?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Sure.
No! What gave you that idea?
Sounds like a good one.
Really?
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Who?
That's a big book you're writing.
How did I get here last night?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Humboldt County?
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
When we fall, we fall hard.
It feels really... good... here.
So, why did you take me up there?
Want a bite?
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
I thank you.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Professor Tripp.
I need to talk to you.
You go first.
Emily left me this morning.
Well...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
Oh?
Inside.
And what do you think you might have said?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Does he still love you?
That's a nice greenhouse.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
It's Grady, Walter.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
I... I...
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Is it good?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
A jockey? You mean, like --
I doubt it, darling.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
I'm working on it.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
Cherry.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
Fucking Mariners.
The birthday party.
No thanks.
It's not what you think.
I'm just talking, man.
I can't.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
You don't know?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
I don't know.
I wasn't feeling well.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
No.
Banished... yeah.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
But will he... ?
And how's your job?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Why not?
Of course.
How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Have to talk about something.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Do you think you're crazy?
Is that what you are angry about?
I mean, when will I be normal.
I'm afraid not.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
What is your idea of being a Jew?
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Why?
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I'm only asking questions.
Me?
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Southern light.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
What?
Is that all?
Why do you want to know?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Molested little girls?
What did you do to them?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
You really believe that?
You know, this is crazy.
You must hate your brothers.
No you don't.
Are you serious?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Sneak up behind me like that.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Lord Almighty.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You never did like being called that, did you?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
What happened?
But what did he see that made him panic?
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
How deep?
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
That must be Basiluzzo.
More so than the shark?
Somebody must live here!
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
And why did you drop them?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
You say that just to flatter me.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
But where did you come from?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
You know, I don't love anybody.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
He talked to you Himself?
One of the other Sisters?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
That's not what he meant.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
It's not that... it's not that...
Let's talk about something else.
Yes.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, I know he does.
And you like that?
No. I was sick.
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I fell asleep.
Don't you know?
No.
I've stopped menstruating
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
How did she know that?
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
A mistake...
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
What did you do?
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
She tells you you're ugly?
That you're a mistake?
Alright.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
No.
To be a mother?
I can't tell you that.
We went to chapel for vespers.
What do you think it's there for?
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
Why?
Who?
Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Stay away from me...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
H... how?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Look into the convent records.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
No, no, no...
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
You can call me Sister.
I can beat that.
I haven't a clue.
Yes, but I...
I believe Agnes is different.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
And in your eyes?
It's possible isn't it?
Not simple, no.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
How?
When was that?
Sister Paul?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I don't think I care to know.
The woman's health is at stake.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Begin what?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
Who is he?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
This is permission to take her apart.
Hasn't she had enough?
Did you know she was pregnant?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
The usual ten per cent?
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Yeah.
The police station.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Ta.
But I won't.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
I beg your pardon?
Ringo!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Gear?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Aye, I knew you were.
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?
How d'you reckon that one out?
He's got you worried, then?
Gie's a kiss!
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Hello.
Oh you are, I know you are.
He belongs to Paul.
Well ...
He's been gone a long time.
What is he?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
What is it?
You want to try?
What's wrong?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Hard to say.
Yes?  What is it?
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
No, I don't want us separated.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Recognizable!  In that?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
There, it caught!
No, it's coming.
No, thank God... just missed him.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Where are we?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
I understand why you did that.
Take us up.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Where are you?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
You win some, you loose some.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Careful of that edging there...
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Compensate!
Four.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
That's the wrong way!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
You have to...
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
It needn't be.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Eddie...
Just some coffee.
I don't think that's funny.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Why'd call me a killer?
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
... and Karen.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I never intended you to be.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
She was a liar, she was a liar!
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Margo.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Eve! My understudy...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Good luck, genius...
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
I get a party, don't I?
Yeah... I will.
I thought you were going to be late-
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
It's all over.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Who?
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
It's obvious you're not a woman.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Just wondered what?
Why.
So few come back...
Ah...
What have I got to do with it?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
The same size?
Of course!
How do you do, my dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
She's loyal and efficient-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
Don't be dense. The party.
Who are you?
You were just looking around...
You probably won't believe me.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
May I have your coat?
Oh, but there is-
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I'm not crying.
Addison wants me to play it.
Congratulations, Eve.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Hello, Miss Channing.
They're your fans, your audience-
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
It doesn't matter.
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
What about Bill?
Well...
I remember.
How was the concert?
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
Eve.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
What's so funny?
I'm a human being, I've got some!
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Margo, you haven't got any age.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
That's beside the point.
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Yes, sir.
That's right, but I don't understand-
Play it again.
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--mine's better--
--no way--
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Goddamnit--
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
Were you eyebrow reading?
I never scared anyone before.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we will--
--shit, who do we know?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
How high up, which Republicans?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Woodward?
Hmm?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
What does it say?
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
Morning or night?
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
Any idea what he did?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
Can't help you.
--so?
--that was awhile ago--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hey... very tense.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
Hey, easy...
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
The ones who could disburse the money.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
What happens when the baby comes?
--this'll only take one second--
--I saw him. He verifies.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--I'm not here.
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
They are not my clients.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
But it's possible.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Who's Charles Colson?
--has any of them got an ax?--
--which Young?
Mr. Sloan?
A boy or a girl?
Thanks coach.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
...okay...
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Single malt?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
This is your plan, Finch?
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Not bad, Chris.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
What's that?
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
You mean...and orgasm?
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Of course.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks.  It was my idea.
There's our man.
Did I miss anything?!
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
I know, Dad.
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yes.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
I told you.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay, I get it.
Who cares?
You can do that?
Yes.
No...you...go...ahead.
Well...uh...
Strip?
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Kevin, this is serious!
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Let me know.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
I don't know.  How do you?
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
What?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Our last game is this Saturday.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Really?
Also like sex with my wife.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Are you crazy!?
Where?
Didn't even have to ask.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
You on drugs? Huh?
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Another step and he's dead!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Yeah?
Uncle Terrence.
Because Gaston was after it.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Enough. Cut him loose.
What did she say?
What were you showing her?
Who did you hear it from?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Is everyone all right?
I shant!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
By pulling my hair?!
Come on up!
Dmitri?
Who are you, child?
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
What?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Trust me, it's her!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
I'm getting a chest cold..
You're a princess...
What do we do now?
How is our current financial status?
What do you mean?
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
I should go
And tell me that she's happy.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
You gave the orders!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Yes.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Alvy, I...
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Hi. Hi, hi.
You-you play... very well.
Me? Oh, downtown!
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Oh, right.
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
Yeah.
Well...
Neat?
Oh, I see, I see.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
what I mean?
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Yeah.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
How is it any different?
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Were you always funny?
Yeah.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Okay, let me have this.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Remember, we had that thing.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
Christ!
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You look very pretty.
You're mad, aren't you?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Don't get upset!
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Where are you going?
You have a raccoon?
I can think of another word.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
May I see your license, please?
You're crazy!
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
M'hm.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Oh.
Yeah.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Absolutely not.
What's that?
And you've only just met.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
You don't have any clothes on.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
She left a note.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I adore him.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
We've only been over this how many times?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What?
I mean, you're really back.
Don't get it.
You want me to uninvite her?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Don't be so sure.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
She left the fucking gate open.
Well he can't have gone far.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Cal, too?
Anyone else?
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Will you make love with me?
It's a novel.
Yes.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Do I put you off?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
No you're not.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
Lemon or raspberry?
That's a lot of those.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
How do you do, Skye?
I think there are sixteen there.
Well, yes, actually.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Ryan!
I'm sorry.
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Oh?
Oh?
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
I wasn't finished.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Thanks.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
You're my best friend.
Monica and Ryan.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
The both of you.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Well...  I declared war!
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
We're going to die!
And only you can become a Queen?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Barbatus!
Oh, no, sir!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Affirmative.
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Ma'am?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Care to make a small wager?
Oh, I never catch colds.
That makes me feel just terrible.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
Here.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
His apartment?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I would.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
I mean, after that?
I don't?
Fine. How's your eye?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I never thought he'd do it.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Baxter?
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Where is your apartment?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Don't mind what?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
You?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Help yourself.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
I'm not sure.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
What about him?
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
No kidding.
Good night?
A.W.O.L.?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
Well -- thank you.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I never said goodbye, Fran.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Stop that, Fran.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Are you there, Fran?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
What gives?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Winning the war by yourself.
That's good gin.
What unit were you with ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
What are you doing out here?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Not a thing.
Yeah, I know.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
What'd he say?
Flood.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
Who is he?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
What's the furthest you been in?
Who knows.
I'm Kurtz.
What do you mean, Colonel?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Go away -- hide yourself.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
Did you know him very well?
Are you finished surfing?
No -- no, Captain.
Why?
What will you do after the war?
Yes.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
So that's it.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
What show ?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
34   CONTINUED:
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
215  CONTINUED:
119  CONTINUED:  
39   CONTINUED:
Had?
Why?
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Did you catch Corbett?
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Let's go.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Been driving long?
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
You know Meyerling?
How many do you see?
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You broke the radio, remember?
Shut up!
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
I need to rent a cabin.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
What are you talking about?
Neff, you know better than this...
What does this matter to you?
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Thought that door was open last night...
It's Sam Wilder!
Go ahead.
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
I'm sorry.
How long has he been having problems?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Me. My home number is on this card.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Sorry.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Note. Put it in the note.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I can't. I work.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
Stop asking everyone.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
And mean it...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Hello.
I can trust my brain.
Go ahead.
What do you want, Melvin?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
You know what? I...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
But what about...
What the heck are those for?
You changed the room around...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Shall I get her for you?
No. Please, don't force him.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Oh, is he dead?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
It smells like shit in here?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Melvin...
What did she say?
What's it mean?
Where you from?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Probably.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
So what happens now?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
What?
You think this is a fucking joke?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Ten million --
Who is that other guy?
Right.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Electra.
More or less.
My first take?
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Yes.
Sorry.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
Then, we wait.
Yes.
Was that it?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
What?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
What happened to her?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
I waited another four minutes.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Average.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
That's correct.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No....The Asylum!
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We're going to need it all.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Do you think anyone will really come here?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Why don't we go together?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
That bad?
Yeah, somewhere?
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
God, I think I need a holiday.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
It's that one isn't it.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
What?
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
What? You are crazy!
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
No, I love you, really.
If you get out can we be together again.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Can we charge admission?
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
And take Jiri with you?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
We_re not all running away
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
That's right.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
I'm not sure it's possible.
And the students?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
So, he didn't fire you?
When the hell did you write that?
You bastard!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Very well.
What if they expel you?
'Bout what?
You saw him?
He wants to show now.
Thanks.
I could take after Dad, too.
What are you doing here?
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
I don't make small talk --
'Is it really me?'
What the -- ?!
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
I'll take a chance.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Hey.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
Loved?
Assholes. This happen to you?
What would you do up here?
Jamie --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Are you frightened?
It's gone now.
I'll talk to your father.
No. I want what's best for you.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
No.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
I'd work backstage or something?
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
Morning Dick.
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
What's N.R.C.?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Learn anything?
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Maybe if I used my left....
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Who, me?
What?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Pardon me?
The power converter...
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
What do you call this? 
Obviously!  
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
You like people?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Hi.
Great.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Why not?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I can look and see.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
That's Montana over there.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Just thinking.
Just gimme a chance.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
Arachtoid.
We will, old fried, we will.
This is so embarrassing...
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
The girl I remind you of.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Pick those up, Reno.
Why me?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Before what?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I write.
How long you been up there, Fink?
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on –
...I just don't know what... to do–
...Where did we put him?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I – Mr. Lipnik –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
L.A.P.D.
What did... What did he –
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Who?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
How long were you having sex with him?
What's your new book about?
But you didn't hurt --
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
How exactly did you hear?
Why not?
Ice?
I'll risk it.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
What did he say?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
How'd you get in here?
Why?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Was she ever a suspect?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
I never heard of him.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
What is it you got between you?
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I'm not afraid of her.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
What was the motive?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Fuck you, Phil.
You knew her, didn't you?
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Why do you think he's dead?
Hey – it's the big A.M..
Naa..
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Is Jean Michel here?
How much for these five?
When?
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Not what?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Really?
Paint it out.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Who am I?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
You got a date already?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
What's wrong with me?
How is he?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –
Yeah, it's the best one.
It's three thousand dollars!
Would you check out my studio some time?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Come on.
You're a fast mover.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
No.  No glass on the inside.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
It does to me.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
What is it?
You have?
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
I am as well as can be expected.
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
I'm on break from-
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Can he save her?
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
She knows who we are.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
No gun.  How disarming.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
I find that unlikely.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
It'll never work.
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
What?
Mystery.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
How ya doin', Al?
My life's an open book. You read?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Rinka.
To kill me.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
I need to be part of this.
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Great.  Give me a grant.
Do you want a drink?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
No one would miss me.
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
MOVE! Can't you do something??
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
It isn't working any more, David.
Go ahead.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Everything's gonna be fine.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
It's very good Bernie.
Everything okay, David?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
... in the distant future.
Why thank you sir.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Me first!
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Butt-snatch...
Uh... butt-snatch...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
I see it. I don't get it.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Where are his pants?
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
You'll be rich!
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Here's something.
Honey.  Let's go.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Little black party dresses?
What time is it?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
What is going on?
Are you available?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
How'd you do on the science test?
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Okay?
Maybe Charles does.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Is this the key to the attic?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Your family doctor?
Did you lose something?
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
He does...?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Yes. I was.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Chauncey...
Thank you, Eve.
... Good night, Chauncey.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Yes. I like that name very much.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Bravo!
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
What about money?
Yes. Of men and women.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I agree.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
You're welcome.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
No. I don't object.
Yes.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Yes. It has.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
No! He's a real gardener!
This is not what I requested.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Ben!
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Who am I thinking of?
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Morning.
What?
The monkey.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Seven-ish
Right.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
My God!
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Pardon?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
No.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Hello, Don.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Yes, my dear?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Count me in.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Mr. Malkovich?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
What want ye, girl child?
Well?
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
You grown.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Mama let me help you.
She likes this dress...
I know what I see.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
It's her, ain't it?
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
That's so.
Just me.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
You don't know what I think.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Can we just rent it from you?
Sir, please lower your voice--
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
They were Nazis, Dude?
No--
Am I wrong?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
No.  Here.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Far from it.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Well--sure, I could do that--
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
She most certainly was not!
Now I got--
Dieter Hauff?
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Increases?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Am I wrong!
Donny!  Please!
Huh?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey man--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
The what?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Huh?
What the fuck?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Uh-huh.
Then what's...
Wha.
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Yeah.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Mind if I smoke a jay?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Shit, sorry man.
Walter--
He's half yours, partner.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What is it with you people and pain?
Recognize him?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
What?
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
So?
So you're going to do this?
Nomak?
Getting your attention, Paco.
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
Tell me something, Skid --
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
I don't buy it.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're blind --
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
What are you doing?!
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What do you see here?
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
It's dark in here.
Some. It's been slow --
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
You.
Blade --
Whistler!
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
No.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Something was wrong.
Let's talk to your husband--
What?
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Anna--
--or someone--
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
I don't know yet.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
The witch?
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
I don't believe this.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
What I never could figure about the movie?
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Fucking owl!
What the fuck--??
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Be it still alive, James?
For "James?"
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--turn the camera off--
--Graduate Thesis--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
This isn't about us.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
--whatever you want, no problem--
You planning on sleeping out there?
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
Women miscarry all the--
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
Anna--
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
What happened to my Dad??
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
When you don't they're usually nice.
What do you want to know?
...So what're you doing tonight?
He needs a room, Dusty.
What?
What's the matter?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...Count it if you want.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Howdy stranger.
Thanks Meurice.
...Why?
Where was I?
What day is it today, Angie?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Hello, baby.
Hello, daddy.
. MOMMY!.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nobody.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Do you know?
You don't?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Don't say that.
Frank is coming?
I want you to hurt me.
Shut up.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You called me Jeffrey.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Yeah, it's me.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
I don't want to go.
Yes.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
You were late.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Everything okay?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
It's okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
No.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What time are visiting hours?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
No. you're right.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Yeah, I know.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Blanca, por favor.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Tuna, this is crap.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
What the fuck is that?
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Because they caught me?
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Derek Foreal.
What?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Not mad.
No.
That was a beautiful message.
How are you doing, George?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
What do you want?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
I don't know.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
California, huh?
Swear on my life.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
Okay, George.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Right on.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Don't move, Hacene.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Go away!
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No, and neither were my men.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
So -- where do we start?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What'd he die of?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Objection!
No -- never.
How did he look?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Why not?
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes.
Did you suggest any?
That's enough.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Why does she come to you?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Yes -- he did.
What changed?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Yes.
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
Three fifteen.
You didn't know about it before that?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
-- And then?
This is your house.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yes -- she did.
Sorry.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Can I see you later?
What's that for?
You killed him -- didn't you?
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Really?
If he files are you going to take the case?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
What's wrong?
Yes.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Please -- not now.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
That's too bad.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
What?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Was this during Betty?
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
You want me to call the doctor?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Want another cigarette?
About a year and a half.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
I'm sorry. That was...
No. I'll do them later.
Yes.
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
So what happened?
Woman friends, too?
I told you, I love other people.
No, I'm just saying --
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Yes.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
No. I couldn't.
Yes, thanks.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
STOP IT!
No one's asking you to!
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
What's she like?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Oh my God...!
What happened?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
About an hour ago.
Don't feed that dog.
You people really don't like dogs.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Since we was just grasshoppers...
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
You know I can't.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Bill!  Bill?!
Let me see it.
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
What are we doing down here?
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
But the place burned to the ground.
Evidence of what?
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Just admit it, Caesar.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
The next one blows off your dick.
No, Gino!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Not bad.  What for?
They were early.
The money?  The money's gone.
But it could be anywhere.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Where, then?
Stupid cunt!
I had to.  You made me.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
You can't kill me yet.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
You got the key?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Are they really?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Yeah.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Okay, one drink.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I don't understand - ?
Because it's the truth.
Even though he knew about you?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
You think I'm lying?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Yes.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Yeah, twice.
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
An accident.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
What do you want to do?
What do they want me to do?
So it's time to go home.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.  Is he there?
Who?  Who came?
Did you?
I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus... 
So what's in Paris?
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Where?
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I trusted you.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
But the police --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
xxxxxx...
What's that?
-- I'm on it --
...Be back.
... fix themselves.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What? You mean you've got ...
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
If I can help you ...
Sorry ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Hello, Jack!
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
You got the wrong man.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
So what are you going to do about her?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
It could all be coincidental.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
It does doesn't it?
Every day?
Turn around!
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
I was right! Step on it!
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Your face ... are you hurt?
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
A cheque.
Tuttle?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Er, don't you want to search me?
But we can get one.
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
No.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
I know him. That's Noel.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
Don't seem so bad to me.
The ghosts--
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
What look?
He got better.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
The family know?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
How can that be? He was getting better.
He was tough. You did all you could.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Turn it off.
Don't push it, Larry.
Mr. Oh.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
No.  Don't worry about it.
I don't think so.
You know what I...
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Nine seconds.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Did it really go well?
No.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
This is important to me.
What?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Speaking.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Goodbye, Paul.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
No stop where he's all besieged.
No...no.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Anchor?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Ernie, they're calling from work.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
If we could just eat first.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
Who?
At least kiss me when you do that.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Hi.  It's me.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Yes.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No.  Did he really?
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Don't you work here?
What are you doing here?
I'm almost ready -
Not even a little bit?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Anything new?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
You really like it?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Yes Walter.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
No! I want to talk about it now!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Are you alright?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Would you pose for me for free?
I wonder what his deal is.
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Well, w-what did you do?
I can't talk right now.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Smack?
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Let me in.
Invite me in, Pike.
Buffy, honey?
You okay?
I am a God!  A God!
You want some water or something?
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Dress, huh?  What for?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Not a pressing issue.
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Not if you're careful.
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
As for example, what?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
There isn't time.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
The mark of the Coven.
Hi, Grueller.
No --
The homelesses?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
What?
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
A little better.
How 'bout a back rub?
That's my leg.
You don't have to...
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
She's dancing with me.
Crash, I didn't think you--
See my hips?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Damn.
Your place or mine?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
I want to be had.
He won't make love to me anymore.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh dear....easy honey...
You need a nickname.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
I didn't spit on you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
You been in the Majors?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was great, eh?
I'm going to the Show.
You fuck!
Forget it.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
We'll be praying for you.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Well tell 'em, honey.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
You were never my guest?!
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Was I at that dinner?
But what happens when they do find out?
What do you propose?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Yeah.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Right back.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
They payin'?
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Hello.
You should say so.
My wife?
Hey, she came to talk...
Okay?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
What are you -
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Yeah.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
Hello.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Okay. You come by the house?
I...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
Nice to see you, Senator.
This woman's an institution.
Now, he's really pissed.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Yeah.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I didn't take your pills.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
How serious?
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
With what?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
I threw it away.
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
What if he won't stop?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
That's amazing.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
This is not the way to treat people.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Can you do it with your left hand?
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Hey.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Hey!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Yeah?
Carmine left?
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
For what?
Of course, Remo.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
I can see that. Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
It's what you want?
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
You are.
Promise?
Okay, then.
Lester - he called you here.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
You know why, right?
Get up.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Charlie M.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
That's enough.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
The crowd bought it.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
We're waiting.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Wha-at?
What do you want from me?
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
I still have one left...
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I'm a good mother!
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Good morning.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Not too cool...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Okay, deal.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
You seem sad, Spooky.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Say something ...
What's this?
You missed.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Bullshit.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
You don't understand.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
I don't believe you.
Don't lay this on me!
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Where'd they take you to?
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Stop throwing names at me.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
What do you do for a living?
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
What do you mean?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Not a chance.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
No.
God, if he doesn't come back --
Your husband?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Damned if I know.
At least one.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
You wouldn't --
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Naturally.
Both hands on your lap.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Who are you working for?
You're up on your details, aren't you?
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Where do we meet?
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
Stay there.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Don't worry.
Who am I talking to?
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Government business?
So who's he?
How?
See that, Col?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He's still looking, Col.
He's back, Col
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
How'd you guess?
Hi.
You know.
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
What look?
Someone out there.
You mean that?
What you thinking of, hon?
No...
Give it over, Dil --
That's a start.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Don't.
Sorry.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You gonna tell me why?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
She's the thing you had to tell me.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You said anything, Dil
So it's true, then?
Come on...
You heard what I said, Dil?
What?
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Got to be somewhere.
What would you do for me?
Never.
It's my name, Dil --
Not if you go.
What was it?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Horny bastard.
He's all right.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
I heard.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Dil!
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Definitely unusual.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Right.
Thank you, handsome.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Why did you sign up?
And you play cricket?.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Doesn't matter where.
Who's Dil?
I didn't.
Don't.
A story.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Nothing.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
The teddy bear?
What if I did?
Who gives a fuck.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
What are you talking about?
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
No -- I guess not.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
You're going to look for him -- now?
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Let's look anyway.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
But I didn't kill anybody.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
His -- real -- ?
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Who?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Keep going.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your --
Yes, but we're divorced.
You can't.
There must be some way.
Said what?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
What? Assassinate somebody?
Got you.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I don't believe it.
In money.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Mrs. Lampert --
Leave me alone -- !
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Oh, la.
How's that?
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Who is it?
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Didn't Charles have any friends?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
It's almost ten o'clock.
You said that two weeks ago.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You were eavesdropping.
St. Michael's.
Of what?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Pay no attention to me.
You gave me a 'D'.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
I was desperate. It was gross.
He says he loves me.
Especially not your dad.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Cut it out.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
What?
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
They're not picking me up until six.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Yes?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
His mother's side.
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
You're so beautiful.
Ok.
No.
What?


The guy's a fuckin' moron.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
He could've called first.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
That dog ain't mean.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-damn!
Take your gun!
Doesn't...
 Yeah...
I did not steal the truck.
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Whoo!
 Oh...
Hang on!


Okay.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
 Okay.  Okay. 

What?
Worth a try.
It won't even start half the time.
...truck.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...

I think you oughta cut a...
...man.

Put your hand in my pants.
 Come on!
Okay. 



...tunnel!
What?

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Hold this. 
Who put the big hurt on...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Thank you.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

But...
Vaughn.
Mason, you have to take this...
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
However, you are also non-en-...
Is it--?
Any of them Richard Long?
You have my word on that.
You look good, Richard.
...-ple.
Grateful?
...you were right, of course.  But after...
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
All right.  After they put you away...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
...here!
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Of which we have more than enough.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him again.
It's clean.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
You know the suspect?
...-fall.
It's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
I assume you have one.
Hello.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...




Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Yeah?
There's something else too.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
You got thirty minutes.
Rangers.
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
...tight!
What's going on, colonel?
It must've happened right after we left.
...-five.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...try this one out some-...
Call an ambulance.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
 ...miles. 
Where are you now...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
Got that?
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...on the other end of this phone.
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...tunnel now!
What the hell was that?
All right, go.
The usual.  Doc.

I'll stay here and secure this position.
That's right.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Sir?
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Just find the girl.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Oh they don't?
Could you drive me somewhere?
Okay.
I've been wanting to meet you.
I get by.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No. It was an accident.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
Where?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
Why?
Did he know?
No. I'm just a snoop.
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
The Albacore Club.
I am not!
She's too upset.
I can't...
Upstairs. Why?
What are you saying?
That's good. Now what's her name?
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
How do you know?
Sophie.
Ida Sessions.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure you do.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
...Yes of course.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
What about?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Neither do I.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
She ran away?
Well, you never know, do you?
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Then where's the money?
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
So what's that got to do with it?
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I intend to find out.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You've got some on your face.
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
At night?
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
Oh, yes, sir.
Tired?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Charlie -
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Brad, you are drunk.
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Was he in love?
Sure.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Well, thanks a lot.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Are you sure?
What the hell is that?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Hey, now wait a sec...
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
So where is he?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
You lie.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You work in a market, all right.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
What about Sing?
So what are you saying?
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
How'd you get here so fast?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Yeah.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
You're late.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's cheating?
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
You think things would be any different now?
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
The Emperor.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Basically.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Which ones?
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
FUCK!
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
We're not playing in the street.
Oh, my god.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
An embarrassing way to die.
Broke his neck.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
What's that for?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
What?
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Thanks.
You still didn't have to choke me.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Same time. What about you?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Veronica.
Lasagne.
She's my girlfriend.
Meaning?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
You're kidding.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Really?
And I actually date you?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Why'd you hit me?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
All right. Name it.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
You sucked that guy's dick?
That's because I never had sex with him!
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
I'm going to class.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
That's the price, my brother.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
I don't know.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Where are you, Walker?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I love you, too.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Sure you can.
Four...five...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Why are you yelling?
Excuse me?
Gabe!?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Have her come up.
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing--
Don't use my name!
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
What about it?
He's alive!
Rich...
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Been punished, yeah?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Won't you join me, sir?
Phoned some friends, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Alex.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
I did, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Helping you, sir?
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
C of E, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Through there for a bath.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
But it was horrible.
Yes!!!
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Mothballs, sir.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Don't read it - sign it!
Hullo, son, how are you?
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
The ride is free.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Just had one.
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Where are you, what floor?
A deer?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Lay it on me.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
What's your name?
I got caught up at work.
You're kidding me.
Let's not get excited, sir.
Yeah?  So?
Yeah?
Hello?
It's not that kind of job.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
The trunk?
Got it?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
South Central.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Yes.
How can you kill him like that?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Vincent?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Show up for what?
What difference does it make?
Gimme your wallet.
Why?
Paid sick leave?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
No, not just that.
There you go...!
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Look, I'm sorry --
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Saved you last night's, too.
Do you still ride?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
Six months.  Eleven days.
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Who?
Was that who I thought it was?
Is this your dad?
Did you see the van back there?
What van?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
They're big details, Jerry.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
Connecticut.
My father's house.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
I'm sorry.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
And what did I say?
A dog.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Night after that?
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Do you believe me?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
What do you suggest?
So?
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
You're --
Meaning...
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
What?  Why?
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
What does it say?
What...
No primer.
This is how you see the sky?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Am I one... or many?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
Hokkaido Island.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
And?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
It's good to see you, Ellie.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
What day?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
What'd you think?
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
It's getting late...
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
You're trembling.
Ellie, what is it?
What are you so afraid of?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Recommendations?
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Lookit her bounce.
Go hard!
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here's the Patrol.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Pair'a nines.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
A cold drink? Okay?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Take it easy, Drag.
On my own.
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
What did I do?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
What pattern was that?
You get me out first.
What Friday?
Where is it?
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Nothing.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
You're afraid of him.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Are you always so bold?
Tell me what to do!
Yes.  I have to go...
You know how to use this?
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Michael Johnson.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
Detective Niccoletti?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Did you come?
It's about time.
It is?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
You haven't told me where we're going.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
You look beautiful.
What's his name, Letty?
Tell us every detail.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
You too, Mom.
Mom, please.
I'm only looking out for you.
There's a spider in my room.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Letty.
What are you looking to read?
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Really, this isn't funny.
I wish I could have seen that.
What else would you do?
Your family just met me.
Tell me all.
So there were no problems?
No, I need some serious household advice.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
It's TV heaven.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Good luck.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
What are we going to do?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Are you all right?
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
All tapped out.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
It's Daniel.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
No thank you.
I'm good.   Really.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Why are you here?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
We can't.
Get that, will you?
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Do they come with batteries?
That moron.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
This is Zero.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Hadley --
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
How much?
Yeah?
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
French guys?    You mean like from France?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
What'd you guys find?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
Give it to me, Sami.
What happened?
Yeah.   It's mine.
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
And you don't speak French?
What does arresting us get them?
Can't sleep?
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
It's for you.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
You're back!
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I don't care about your sword.
And if I use them to kill you?
What's it to you?
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
You know about Lo?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Kneel!
Let's stop a moment.
Yes.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
No.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
What about you?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
My name.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Do you feel okay.
In a better place.  I hope.
Well, how's your friend?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Miss her?
Shut up.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You what?
Nothing.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
From who?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
How do you know I've been with several women?
The Fountainhead.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Without question.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
I do.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Would you like a tour?
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
But you knew this was important to me.
- none taken -
Any ideas who it could be?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I don't think that bothered him.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
Something awful happened last night.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
No.
Is it me?
I do.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Is she with you?
No.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Even there?
Fuck her yet?
I'm working on it.
What's your plan of attack?
That her?
She shot you down.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Excuse me?
It clearly is why.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
Let me get that for you.
Excuse me.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Nope.
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Did you hit her?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.
Do you know the people?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Well, it seemed to me --
What?
It's your play.
What's funny?
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Yes, I did.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
Now Amy
It was just a voice.
Daddy!
Yes, Amy?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
I'm your friend.
You'll always play with me?
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
May I pet the deer?
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Will you come soon?
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
And does he kill people?
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
Give him the tampon test.
How'd it go with the cop?
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
What did he say?
Charming Carlton.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
I've been here. What day is it?
Oh no.
Get rid of him!
What? Why'd you do that?
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
No. I won't let you do that.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
I do development for TV movies.
I'm not really hungry after all.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
So pee? Here?
You look different. I mean you look good.
You never say that.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
Script coverage?
No?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Like what?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
I really gotta get going.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is that how you feel?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
Your breasts feel larger.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
No, I have a cat.
She's just so... pathetic.
Take some allergy medicine.
Why would you want to be a cop?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Sell maps?
Not really...
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Just visiting my patient.
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
What is this place?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
What?
I didn't realise...
You know something about me?
Can I get my life back?
I'm sorry.  About before.
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
They barely talk anymore.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What do you think you're doing?!
Where's the girl?
Till what?
A condition...
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
No!...  WE didn't anything...
What are you gonna do?
Don't do this.
I don't think so
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I'm not sure.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
That'd be great.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
At a press conference.
Wrong...
Alan...
We've got to fix this.
Does it make the cars any better?
You got a gun?
I was waiting for that jack.
What are you staring at?
What?
That's a secret.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
What's wrong?
They're crucifying you out there.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're all set,  sir.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Help me get him to the boat.
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Sounds boring to me.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
It will?  How do you figure?
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
What do you mean you don't know?
Well...
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Nuwanda?  Please?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Who's in?
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
No.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
But I love you.
Then come with me.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
Courtyard?
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Okay.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
What is it?
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
My brother went here.
Yes.  But
So?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Visit from my father.
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Hanover, listen...
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
You don't have to be so touchy.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Got it?
Like cattle...
What?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Joey...it's okay...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
She fucked us both.
Yeah.
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
I do!!!
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
I have to go.
But you must come in.
I have to go.
Where is he???
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
She's in back.
Thanks.
How was huntin'?
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Not so good.
Kind of. You didn't know?
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
What kind of beer would you like?
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Frost.
No-o-o!
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
You're going hunting?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
Who the hell is he?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
The shot?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
I thought you might be praying.
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Forget Sal.
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
How's Linda?
No.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Did you go hunting.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Yeah.
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Who is it?
I want to ask you a few questions.
I want to see my wife and kid.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Not the 'T' word.
You my partner?
But Sergeant...
You need anything else?
You want to be a good detective?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
What's this?
...What are you talking about...?
You okay?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
What's your name?
This little thing says I can't.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Jabez -- ?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Sure am.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
-- in gold.
You are afraid!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
But -- I was just lucky.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
We can still use my butter money.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
It don't matter!
It's all right, Sheriff.
Let him try it.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Come in, Sheriff.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Mary -- Jabez --
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Bullshit.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
These seats come out?
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Yeah...
Yeah... I know.
What trip?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I like that... yeah!
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Shit...
Well, then...
It's my only chance!
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
Oh no!
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Sonny-boy, one word?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
He wanted to kill me!
You tryin' to fuck me?
Yeah ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
I want to talk to him.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
Do you think we can turn it on?
Are you a lawyer?
You got Bank Americard?
Because I don't want cancer.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
It's the cops.  Shit!
Does that still go?
They're trying to come through the door!
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Oh - Maria!
What are you trying to pull?
Hey, you okay?
Hey, let's get ready!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
We can't stay here.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
And if you can't deliver them?
This is Bishop.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Yes.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Cool it, Choco.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
You were good.
How you be?
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Ya back is got.
Yo!
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
I'm gonna leave now.
So?
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Ask Sal.
You the man.
Make it plain.
You're a drunk fool.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up!
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
Sorry, comb got caught.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
C'mon, Sal.
Keep it.
You keep it.
You a blue-moon fool.
Later for you.
What?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Be a man.
You talk to 'em.
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Hey!  Watch it.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
You're it.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Hi.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Mom, you know that never works.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
H A R R Y...
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Peg leg?
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Shut up!
Just wanted to see how your doing.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
No. What happened?
George Washington!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Cute puppy.
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
She's one of a kind.
Sorry, Charlie.
Oh, you're good.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Well, something stinks.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
He passed away three years ago.
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
What papers?
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
What's that you're saying?
Yes?
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
No.
It burns.
What is it?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
No.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
No.  I don't work here.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
But you're a big star!
I never thought of that.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
But maybe not.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Sorry...
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
What?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
This is my way of telling you --
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Tor, I should be getting home.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Is there a script?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
What was that?
Uh, atomic energy?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Who's Dr. Tom?
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
Yeah...?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
No! Do they show you having sex?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
How's your mother?
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
You're nuts.
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
He's who we want to go with.
This guy.

What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Right, right...
Eddie? ...
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
He made a mistake.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Oh my God!
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
What is she, at work?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Are you asking me?
Never would be plenty.
I batted!
You batted or you bunted?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Why do it?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
What do you want?!
Leave. Go.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
That's lucky.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
There's a list.
I need to talk.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
You're in show business?
Why do you do that?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Good-bye, brother!
Me?!
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
You don't recognize me.
Hi.
Oh!!
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Mostly Tammy fans
Looks good to me.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Why are you lecturing me?
What do you mean?
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Yep.
Yeah.  I'm here.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
People can see this.
Don't you fucking knock?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Tell me about Patchett.
You fuck for money.
Did they deserve it today?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Yeah, I hate them.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
That's him.  That's him.
Yeah, that's Stens.
Why?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Dudley's guys.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Ellis Loew.
I don't know him.  Mr...
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Nothing.
I never truck with no sissies!
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
I... No.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Ed, I want confessions.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
And now you'll provide them.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Right now, before I back down.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Shut up!
Pacific Coast Bell.
I just called it.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Brill?
DePinto's dead.
What'd he say to you?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
When can you get it here?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Told by whom?
You knew the deal. No contact.
I don't know what that means.
Did you call anyone?
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
None of your business.
Jesus.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
What's going on?
Them.
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
No he won't.
Listen--
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Pretty fast.
He came in four minutes ago.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
It's a little late for that.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
About what?
You tell me.
Than why can't you tell me.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Not that I could see.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Sorry.
I see her for business.
Stacy--
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
That ain't me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
And then what?
When do I get to meet him?
Other than me.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
I know.
For the last four years.
That's temporary.
Rachel--
How?
You have to.
You're a moron, you know that?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
We'd rather not--
Your shoe.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Bobby--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
How long can you stay?
It's okay to use the phone.
What about jewelry?
No, but they took my blender.
What?
You gotta--
I'm sorry, man.
You would?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
We found the originals.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
No sir.
Yes?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Then let's assume I don't.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
He said - be careful.
You sing.  All the time.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Shall we be all right?
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Do they know them?
Will you not come in?
Good.
When were you least happy?
Say you're sick.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
This is - what is this?
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Don't do this.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Tell me about your garden.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Could I trouble you for some water?
If I could just see some identification.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
In my room.
Okay.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
I don't know.
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
She can take you as far as Florence.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
For?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Are you asleep?
How?  How can you see anything?
Could I have a cigarette?
I'll probably marry him.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
I've met you before.
For my hair?
You get Hardy.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
Hello miss.
Whoa - give me a chance!
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Katharine!
You ordering chop suey again?
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
You don't call, you don't write.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
I don't want to waste your time.
Then don't.
You have a car?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
You can't.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
He says they turned the card down.
What the hell was that?
I'm a thief. Sue me.
I don't believe this.
What's my problem? You want a list?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Good morning.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
I go in alone.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
Someone was expecting that.
You were afraid of heights?
We did it.
It's your mistake.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
So how long till we do this?
You shouldn't have.
That's because you grew up rich.
The sign of our partnership.
Hang on.
Put this on!
He looks familiar.
You gave them the eight billion.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Which is--
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
The key to success is using the right tools.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
We're supposed to.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Call it an expression of trust.
I figured that out.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
So you say.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
For what?
Oh, my God.
I don't even know how much money that is.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Excuse me?
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
How many families we talking about here?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Someone's following me.
What?  Who?
What kind of truck?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Uh-huh.
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
It happens all the time.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
How?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
That is not what I'm --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
What?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
You know the Jedi Master?
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
I have felt it.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
What are you so grouchy about?
You, too, golden rod.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
I do not!
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
You look silly.
Thanks to you.
How's your mining operation going?
Get out of here, Lando!
We have no use for your kind.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
What are you talking about?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
I thought I was in good shape.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
What, Lewis?
With food?
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Having second thoughts?
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Not yet.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
No screamin' shit.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Of Merlin?
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
In the great book.
Guenevere...
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
Rise, Mordred.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
Now you must pay me.
I?
To kill and be king, is that all?
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Me too.
No, she was heavily sedated.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Oh, I see.
No. No rats.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
A man to see you.
And those lies she's been telling?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Did he tell you about my party?
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Why, I don't understand?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Yes. He's already here.
Is she gonna die?
Yeah.
Oh I bet he is.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
I wouldn't talk.
I don't know
Do you not like him like daddy?
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
She seemed fine.
I've seen it.
Intensely.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Uoy era ohw.
No.
No momma.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Amen
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
It's possible. Possible however…
Hey, Father? You like movies?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Yeah, come on in.
What about tomorrow?
Twelve years.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
No.
Accident?
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
What's wrong with it?
Lotta water.
Huh?
Jack...
It was an accident.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Seeing anyone in particular?
No, I mean it.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
So what'd we get her?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
So you'll come out, right?
I don't know what you mean.
What?
What's the matter?
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
You hit me.
How about these?
Oh, brother.
Yeah.  Something.
Just a lucky guess.
First night?
Last?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
What're you doing down here?
The party's over.
Couple years.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You're making things up, Frank.
What?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
What're you doing?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
I'll take the Mallory.
Sick?  How sick?
This is where the auditions were.
My watch is broken, too.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
When?
Where's my name?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Shoes?
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Great?
Hey, will you look at that?
What's with you two?
Uh ...
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Thanks.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
It's been a long time, Ma.
I'm not upset.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap?
Long story.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Coffee?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Losing his teeth.
What's a prom?
How'd the show go?
From Hurley's?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Fine work, Jon.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
For what?
Were you there to catch me?
Who is this?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Jon, what is it?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
Not anymore.
You mean like ... condoms?
Kim?
You've got someone in your office.
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
... That's great.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Hello?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Take you, for instance...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Five thirty.  Okay.
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
Trouble at work?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
How’d you know my name?
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
C’mon Jack...
Yeah?  What do you need?
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
Give me my goddamn life back!
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
What're you talkin' about?
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Are you okay?
Jack...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
Hello!
Hey!  I was watching that!
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You really are incredible...
Okay...
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I’m out of the doghouse?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
This place is a perk, Kate.
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Are you okay, Jack?
Kate...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
No...I’m not...
Last night was great...
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
The shields on the station should protect us.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
What's wrong with me?
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
What do you want, Vic?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Back it down, Johnny!
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Front page?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can...make it work.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
You mean <I'm> going along?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
What do you mean?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
But that isn't possible.
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
Atomic fuel?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
All in all, quite a canoe...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
No Jean, no money!
This is a new car, then, sir?
Certainly -
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Personal matters.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
We need more -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Uh-huh.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Yah?
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Yah!
Yeah, but -
Huh? Yah?
Sir? Right now?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Well... yah.
Know who this is?
Yah!
It's okay, Scotty.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah, pretty good.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Mm.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Uh-huh.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
No, no, that's fine.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Nope.
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Linda Cooksey?
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
...Chief Gunderson?
Yah?
Yah.
They're real good.
Your mallard?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Yah.
I love you, Margie.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
That wouldn't interest you.
What... ?
Hmm?
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
Dynamite?
What does that mean?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
What?
I want brain parasites.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Really?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This could go on for hours.
What... ?
Feel anything?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Is that what you're calling it?
Say my name.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
Who's this?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Well, uh... great.
And, now it's gone.
...no ...no ...
Huh?
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
They're called "cigarette burns."
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Alive or dead?
Unbelievable, huh?
What?
Promise?
Huh?
What is this place?
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
You know what I mean.
I want to know --
What are you talking about?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Applicant?"
What's this all about, Tyler?
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You want out?
Ask me nicely.
Why... why... why... ?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
You need me.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
... no, no, no...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Appreciate something.
Abort the plan.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Yes, it is.
Pleeeeeease!
Yesssss...
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
You have to tell us now.
Speed up.
Random, sure.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
What's going on here?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
I guess so.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
I'm... really sorry.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Most kids do, I guess.
Police are coming.
Fag.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
"Next?"
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
No.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Alright.  Home run.
That guy's not going to make it.
You never been in one of those things.
Gawd, you look awful.
Can you handle the door gun?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Not yet.
We just take pictures?
I know.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
What's your name?
Am I out of here?
Those men are all dead.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
<u>What</u>!
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
Hello....congratulations.
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
Can I help you?
Remember. One chorus and out.
.....Me neither.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Hello Lydia?
Yes.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Free?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Where am I?
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
My name is Parry.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Do you follow her every day?
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Parry...
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
What?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
What are we about to do?
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
You said.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
No.
Hey, mack!
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Am I on TV?
Now don't...
Sorry.
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Oh, well, what, what's he...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Look at that.
You're leaving?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
Catherine...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No, don't do that...
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
What?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
And what about love?
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
Well...
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Miss Dupea.
Not now, I'm busy
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
What?
So you got a girl?
You got a boyfriend?
Just chill.
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
Like this?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
What?
Where you know Amanda from?
Jus' from around the way.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
I wasn't asking.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Yes.
That's two.
Your aunt?
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Just relax.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No idea at all?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You gonna nail the chief?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Until she remarries, Fletch.
My lawyer was a bum.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Read this, please.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Yeah. Maybe.
I'm still here.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Where am I going?
They serve dinner on the flight?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
That's right.
You doing a story on this guy?
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Preoccupied with what?
I really should change.
He never sees them and I never met them.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
What are you talking about?
I think you better sit down.
They just left, sir.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Your call is come through.
No wonder.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Utah?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
You'll have it.
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Jim Swarthout?
Who's Frieda?
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Who's your decorator?
Actually, you may take it all now.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
So you...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
All your friends call you Jazz.
You wish.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
Aha, just what I suspected!
What an interface!
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
I'm off it!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
How's it going?
Jazz, we're talking here.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Hi, private eye guy!
This isn't music!
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
How's everything?
Boca?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
Man, I'm clean.
Did they follow you?
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
There's nobody like that on six.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
Yeh?  Who else?
You want some eggs.
Why not?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Strike out, eh?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Give who a tail?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
Suspicion of what?
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Timezit?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Why is it called Hellgate?
What is that old building?
What I know is what I told you.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Yeah.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Switches are shorted out.
Hey, bud.
Damn.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
How was your tour?
Where's Johnny?
You give him his drops?
I swear, Satch.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
You call your son Little Chief?
Oh my god.
I don't know.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
No, not yet.
On the job?
When?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
In my pocket.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Sull!  What the hell!
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Sounds good.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Going?  How do you mean?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Breakfast?
Think you can figure it out?
Will you come with me?
Come on down!
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
And, what about us?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Got any good ideas?
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Who's Horace?
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Is that all you found?
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
What it is?
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
No.
Nancy.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Twenty.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Everything going okay?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
You're talking about my lady.
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
I'm now begging you.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I mean really never.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
What are you going to do?
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
But Sean said...
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Everything okay?
Really?
Rennie...
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
What did you find?
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Guys ready to order?
Say it again.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Tonight. What's tonight?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
Do we care?
Where is it?
We're making too much of this.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
I talked to her two days ago.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Opening night?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
What do we want?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I am really, deeply sorry.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Washed away.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Have to hurry back.
Game six is history,pal.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
Burnt sienna.
This could be it.
You've worked with Elliot?
I think I remember.
Alla puttanesca.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Where are you going now?
Someone waiting for you?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Oww!
Please! You're being foolish!
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
A -- a week.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
What can we do?
It was one incident.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Who are you trying to convince?
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
How much extra?
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Good to see you're feeling better.
You okay, Jerome?
Suit yourself.
You really need that much?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
The Mission Director.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Where are you taking her?
How are you, Jerome?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
German, is that you?
You worried about the cost?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Why would we do that?
Let's walk.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
What do you mean? You've never been there.
What do you want for dinner?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
Doc...
There are three men dead.
I don't want to go there.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
What?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Things can't get much worse can they?
You and me.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
You were with him?
What do you have in mind?
Just fine.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
Nothing. What could I do?
Yes. I told him.
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
Christ, what...
No, don't Jack, don't.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
I want to talk to you later.
It is. Honestly.
I work for him.
Who?
Yes.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Tell me about the girl.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Nice of you to come.
Where's that?
What?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
I won't be using the room tonight.
I'm staying with a friend.
Now just a minute...
Pension him off.
Jack Carter.
No, I didn't know that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
What's that?
...Polacks...
You ever get 'em?
They killed the goose.
We're stuck with this...
For some sales pro...
I heard that they were running cold.
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
Starting up.
What?
You fucking build it!  Men come...
You haven't talked to him.
No.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Did you talk to Graff?
Me?
What if you don't get caught?
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
Do you need five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
They're ancient.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Where was I?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
That's great.
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Levene!
Shelly...
Roma.
Under him?
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Alright.
Now?  Now?
Yes.  I hear you.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
How do you know I made it up?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
It was his idea.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Because I don't like you.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
How was it...?
Harriett...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
You're sure?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
I told you.
She wants her money back.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
She told me I have to.
I...
I...
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
On your pillow.
I'm not hungry.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Is Kay coming?
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Would you like some?
He will grow strong.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
...Who?
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
Chi?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
It was a boy.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
Not for a few years.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Let him gamble.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
You were unfair with them.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
On the phone?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
How much more a month?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
A homo?
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
What do I do?
Nice place.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Or would you prefer a beer?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Did you now?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Does that surprise you?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I'm not, you know.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Can I see what you did so far?
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
You first.
You're the one who started it.
No harm done.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
You are much too human.
Why?
You'll feel better tomorrow.
I'm up.  Thanks.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
This is the studio where I paint.
Then the rumors are true?
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
Can that count as one question?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
I was going to take a swim.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
Jesus ...
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Get out of here, Ray --
You got no choice. It's over.
Let them go --
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I'm on the move -
I'll catch you later, Randall --
What for?
Peugot convertible ...
How's it going -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
Have you seen him?
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
So what are you gonna do?
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What are you doing here?
Where you off to -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Where we going -- ?
How's it going?
What's with the look?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
What kind of trouble -- ?
Six or seven...
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
That what you want?
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
What are you doing... ?
How old are you now, Toby?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Not really --
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
I warned you a million times.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
What are you talking about?
You what?
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
Watch this.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
He heard.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Where'd you find such creeps?
Yeah, yeah.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
No, no. It's okay.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Oh shit.
No way! You're kiddin'!
What are we gonna do up there?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Thanks, Chuck.
You and Morgan throw?
Hi.
Okay.
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
WILL!
Holy shit.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Really?
Okay. How?
I don't know what it's called.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Hey, how you doin'?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yeah, cured polio.
Good to see you.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Oh, that's nice--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Hello, Sean.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
You're getting defensive, Will.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
No.
So Christ, call her up.
My wife's dead.
My wife's dead.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
I know.
Yeah, I think so.
See ya.
What?
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
No.
How many?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
No.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Clearly.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Some, a little.
Do you play the piano?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I want you to come with me.
Yeah, I'm sure.
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Will ya look at her!
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Two.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
*You* find out, I can't.
Crate fell on me.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
You people got a lotta nerve.
You been acrost?
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
California.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
I like the tent better.
No'm.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Ya say we're acrost?
Look, Ma!
When?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Now you done it! You busted it!
You do not.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Bob. Bob Destephano.
What am I gonna do?
What do you want to do?
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
I'm a professional killer.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Which would you rather...?
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Like heroin?
Is it something you've done?
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
You went to school with these people.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Thank you, no.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Well?
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Never enough.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
So what happened to you?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
I'm a professional killer.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What's that to miss?
Poor thing.
Thanks.
Why didn't it work out?
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Who is it?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
That bag's almost empty.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
You've already made arrangements!?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Huh-huh. You?
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Mixed salad.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Ha...
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Why do you always wear that hat?
What does she do?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Now that's cool.
Secret Service!
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
What's that?
Oh wow, we are fried.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
What are you doing?
Up all night again, huh?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Crash Override.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Yes!
Here's your class.
I'm Crash Override.
Name your stakes.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
I'll make it up to you!
Shit!!
There they are!
Yeah.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Excuse me.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
You think they're going to bust us?
So what are we supposed to do?
What the hell was that all about?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
What is it? What's wrong?
What number please?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
I don't know Brady.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Get up there Rachel!
You guys always look great.
We should call the fire department.
Outside.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
I don't want to.
Double scoops?
I thought you said you were ready.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
That's all the windows, Dad.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Its true, Sheriff.
This is starting to spook me.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Shit!
Sure, see you later.
What's the pumpkin for?
What's this big, big news?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Get him out of here!
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yes.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Exactly what do you need?
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
After the movie.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Are you sure?
Let's make more popcorn.
You're coming with us...
Will you get her for me?
There's nothing else I can do.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Thorazin.
Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Ever done anything like this before?
It means... I see.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
What did he say?
Come in, come in.
It depends on what way you want to go.
You're joking.
And you, you-you're going?
Mm-hm.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Oh, Elliot!
Yes, I do.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Yeah.  How are you?
Well, thanks a lot.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Oh!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I almost didn't.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Is something wrong?
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
They're fantastic.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
How about something to eat?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Hmm?
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Who is it?
Like what?!  What?
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
Mh-hm.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Uh-huh.
Ohh?
Don't you think she does?
Singing?
Yeah, can you believe it?
You know.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Hey, hi!
Oh, gosh.
You're too demanding.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
I was so bored!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
I'm okay.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Oh.  Oh.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Hi.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
A reward...
A reward for what?
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
Well.  Word gets around.
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...are they hard to get?
Impossible.
Not with any certainty we...
...are you alright, sir...?
...sir...?
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I've never heard that he...
What would <u>that</u> be?
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...here's to child abuse!
For a consideration.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Said what?
Waal...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
Of course, Commendatore...
...yes.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
And?  Then?
How could you know?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Who does not?
...long overdue.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
...who say...?
Is it necessary to know?
And you let her get away.
You were given backup....
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
What shape is the scar?
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
Then tell me.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
Then what brings you back?
...no...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
No, they're not from Wendy.
Your Secret admirer?
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Yeah. And?
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
So what?                                                    ]
What in the hell did you do that for?
Hey.
Iunno.
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Because you're an idiot.
I'll think about it.
What are you doing here?!
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
No.
No way, no day!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Kurt doesn't look too good.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Let's kick his ass.
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
playfully shoves his hand away.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
Hello!
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Mummy!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
I'm coming with you.
Mummy!
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Must be nice.
What?
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret... what the fuck...?
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Uh... eighty two?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Oh my God. It's coming out.
In a word? Lucrative.
I thought you loved games.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Are you ready?
It's not that kind of date.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
He gives a good report and I walk?
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
I snuck in.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
That's not what I mean...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Ticket!  What's going on?
He lost a shoe!
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
You didn't... get it on with him?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Are you being helped, sir?
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Right.
Sure.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
About us.
Baby, what is it?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
What?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
He wants to see me!
Oh, honey.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Oh God.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Shit!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Lieutenant?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What do you think?
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Leaving what?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Thank you, Thomas.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
No -- I will.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Agreed.
Different places.
Why not?
Are you a cop?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Then who's Russell Nash?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
New York is dangerous place.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
On the back it has--
We're holding the workers down below.
You know it's not safe here for you.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
How can that be?
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
You think we should take that chance?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
Not if they're looking at something else.
There is no way out.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
What?
We been through that.  Forget it.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
I need to work out some stuff.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Thanks for the shirt.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Smith!  Wake up!
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Let it go, Captain.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
What's my name?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
How about you and your sister?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
What do you want?
Marlon and Al....
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I guess we do.
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Paul, you know who this is?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
You are a marked man.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Was there blood?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I couldn't help.
Oh, my God!
No, Odette says he's in shock.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
A Volkswagen.
Please, please try one more time.
No! Sit down now.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
He has taken the presidential suite.
When?
Out? Where are you going?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
What is his room number?
And what's Steven's status?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
Not yet.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Oh dear.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Uhhhh...
Oh, Jesus....
-- closed.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
-- you lose either way, Price --
Don't think it's even an issue.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
It's succeeding!
Where did it go?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You're hurting me.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Steven --
What?
And then what happens?
House 2, Guests 0.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
I was upstairs!
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Rewind that.
It works.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Won't do any good.
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
And you think it's in there?
For the love of God....please...?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Did you find her?!
Can I do it again tonight?
She's down...
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
I can't move!
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
You didn't think much about that before.
I think everything's ready.
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
I'm fine.
Do you think I'm a fool?
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
And what would you do?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
There's something in there.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
I don't know.  Maybe.
Welcome. 38
You're JP Monroe, right?
Thank you.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Yes really.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Joey?
Not quite.
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Oh, I don't ...
Really?
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Hmmmm.....
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
You got about five minutes and change.
Why not just go now?
Anna, I think you better stay....
How.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
And I'll bring my entourage...
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh Hudson...
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
With a little jazz.
The Daddy-Oh!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
It's hardly the same --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
About seven minutes.
A sawbuck!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Well, I --
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
You don't say.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Now, Aim --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
How long've you been down here?
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
This I know, Benny.
I --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah?
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
...Who let you in?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
At the Houmfort.
I'm afraid so.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
Where were you trained?
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Where do you think you're going?
But don't you have to work?
I wish I hadn't heard --
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I suppose so.  Yes.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
You didn't drive her mad.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Wesley!
I don't know -- I don't know--
To the asylum?
Right o'.
Benjie!
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
I wasn't star--
You all right there?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
That shirt?
If you're going to insult me --
You've...
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Hi dad.
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Huh?
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
But...
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
It's not a bother.
Oh.
I used to know how to cook.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
What?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Yeah.
I do.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
You have to follow me?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Hood residence.
And?
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I had him!
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Then change it.
Thanks.
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
So?
Where you signed this?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
What do you want to talk about?
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Stuff.
The other guy?
Hey...
I don't know.
But you wanted to.
Wild card.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Ah! You have questions?
Then God does not exist...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
If you say so. You are innocent.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
You were their leader. They trusted you.
Stop her Louis!
Does it?
He jests.
And you never cried -
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You really want to be with them?
You're sure?
What have I done?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
I can't.
Lestat - finish this -
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
She's here, your wounded one.
What are you saying?
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
How did you do that?
What about coffins?
You loved your wife, surely.
He did it to make you stay with him!
But it has. There is no more to tell.
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Storm season?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
No means yes.
But, he said he'd try.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Don't even think about it.
There's no way to lock it.
You're okay. Thank god.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Who?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
To get out of Southport?
What do you mean, Julie?
There was a body! I swear it!
He's in it with Willis?
...Why?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Rio de Janeiro!
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
We will see who is the first to die.
They were gore before I came here.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
What an odd question!
What is it -- what are you talking about?
It was, the plague
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
Really, this is idiotic!
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Her name is Thea?
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
Daughter -- my daughter --
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Who?
George . . .
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Merry Christmas.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
I . . .
I want you to take a good look at that face.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
What's that book you've got there?
What's that?
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Hey, Ernie!
Hiya, George!
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Is this the place?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Big –– see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Yes, sir.
No.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
You want a martini?
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Maybe you were born older, George.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Violet Bick!
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Neither am I.
Do I look as funny as you do?
You may kiss my hand.
What'd you wish, George?
Have you made up your mind?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh, Mary . . .
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Huh?
Great!  Find one for me.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
It's okay, it's okay....
Yeah.
But the island!
Coming up!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
You coming up on him?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Positive I.D.?
If there is, develop it!
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
I'm going out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Dad, I'm sorry....
Me neither.
What's that supposed to mean?
The whale's mouth?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
That's it.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
All summer?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
What're you going to do today?
What is it?  What's the matter?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Where the hell is Air One?
Did he raise the Kids?
When?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Ready?
Terry!  You okay?
What about the others?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
No.
Not tonight.
They're turning around.
Eat Cheerios.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Yeah.  Down there.
Pre-opening jitters.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
That's a lot of ground to cover.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Michael...
After what happened to us?
Here.
Fine piece of engineering.
Recovering nicely.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Yes, you can.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
Me.
I thought they were clever.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Like hell!
You look like an orange worm.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Thanks for helping.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
He's missing.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Yeah, from Boston.
Depends on big brother.
Besides that.
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Yeah, well I didn't!
Polar bears.
What kind of trouble?
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
He was doing his job....
What the hell are we arguing about?
Where have you been...?
What's wrong?  What happened?
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
I'm hungry, Mom....
We don't want any....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
I'm not going to quit now....
You're having a good time....
You're not a pain in the ass....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
Flies the plane....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Come on, Hoagie....
Still chasing fish?
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Where is everybody?
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
Stop that!
I told you....
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
You want my advice?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
We're going.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
Did he shut you down?
Sure.
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
I'm asking it.
Jesus. What are you doin?
Listen, you don't havta come?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
No.
Have you got a print from the hand?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Three or four.
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Did he get you the job?
Can I see your hands?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
Me?
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
I have to talk to you, Helena.
I know about alcohol, John.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
When did John divorce?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
How you doing on those shoes?
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Can I help?
No no. I knew.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Hey you.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Same to you.
Tell me -- let me help --
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
Please, if I start talking --
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Mmm.  Hmm.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Huh?
No.
No, I air-dry.
You're telling me to dance.
What's wrong.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
I'll get you some quick work --
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
No, you're --
Not everyone has what you have.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Gorgeous.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Jerry --
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Can you be quiet?
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
You hate to swim.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What did you say!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
What?...WHAT!?
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Hmm?
Eric, your parents are both here.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
I want to be an astronaut.
But then you never get to go in space.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
I don't even know this woman.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
What are you guys gonna do?
Where's the power and radio setup?
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
What do they want?!
We can't stay in here!
I have to find Kelly!
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
You think this is all a joke?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
What?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
They are?  I'll be damned.
Once we have control again we - -
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Okay, who's the jerk?
- - like birds - -
Alan?!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
Why not?
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Alan, listen to this.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Hola, Juanito
Up and down, up and down!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
I read your book.
Tim.
I threw up.
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
I can't!  I'm scared!
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
You want to talk about this?
I didn't say I was scared.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Can't you stop these things?!
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
It's safe.
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
Your silence intrigues me.
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
Chain saws.
Jesus Christ!
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
I really think we should go back...
What about that other guy?
Quite a circus.
What?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
He's fucking nuts.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Fascinating.
See this?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
Where do you live?
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Yes -- we do.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
Success or nothing?
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Yes.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
... My ... social situation?
I do.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
When I have no reason to doubt.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
They're not obliged to tell.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
-- Listen to me --
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
Do you?
What's the matter with you?
... Why take me into your confidence?
... A piece of paper ...
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
It usually is.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
I can't imagine you crying.
There's a light up ahead.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
That's your monkey, Denham.
What?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Enjoy.  Well --
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Sure dear, yes.
Yes?
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
Do you always have to repeat?
Sorry. 
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
No, that's not --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Who?
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
What're you gonna do next?
You said it was!
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Mm.
Thanks.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
That who?
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
John, how are you?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
What's in it?
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Not unusual.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Then how are you involved?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Yes sir, we know he --
Does that distress you?
The prospect of losing my child.
What do you like best about her?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Ladies and gentlemen...
When is mommy coming back?
What if she forgets?
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Daddy?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Yep.
Like a principal?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Objection!
Six years.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Somewhere in between.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
What?
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
'Night, Jim.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  Are you there?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're sure?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
No.  I don't think so.
Ted.
All quiet?
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
I miss my brother.
How many?
This many?
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
Do I have money?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
What do you think?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
It is a story, you decide.
This is Britain.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Am I running away?
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
It is possible, Holiness.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
You killed him.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
Jesus Christ!!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
What's that?
No way.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Such the flirt.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
With crocodiles... everything's even.
They could try to tranq him on land.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
I beg your pardon?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
He thinks they're what?
Like little children.  You okay?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
No thanks.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
You calm down!
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
You think?
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You said nobody came in here!
If you get a safe shot...
He's done.  He's dying.
Well.  At wakes.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Yes.
What?
I had a great time last night. Again.
Kelly--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
Backstabber?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
You're all right! Where is he?
I understand.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
That wasn't me.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But if he knew we have so little time -
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Sewing...
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Yes.
It's much better than your shoes.
No, I came because we need -
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Yes.
Mmm. And what else...?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Go, Doctor.
Killed outright?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
No. Tell me why.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
On what basis would they reject him?
All right, then tell me how -
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
But you could. You did.
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Why didn't you bury those people?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
What is it?
Maybe...
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Any powder?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
And what is that?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
What a place for them...
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Sir!
Wampum?
Was there such a thing?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
No way...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Shit...
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
What's wrong with it?
Shut up, all of you.
Thank you, Martin.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
I know that.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
It...almost got you.
It's Sixpack!
How far away is she?
It needs blood?
Are you sure you saw something?
Your pocket?
Hardly.
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Apart from those shotguns.
You get the guns?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Is that you, Dean?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Where?
Out the back.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
Who's this fat man, then?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
I'll see ya.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I like your bar.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
What are you doing, Plank?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
I'll only be a minute.
What have you come as?
Er, well, twelve.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
What do you mean?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
Please.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Nice job.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
350 pounds.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
Come on in--
Where'd he get all this?
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
You know who I am?
That guy who got shot--
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
He's still pissed off about it.
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Maybe.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Mikey look at this--
So where does that put us?
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
That ring--
Treasure hunter?
Good deal you were born down here, then.
So.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Eladio Cruz.
Reputation?
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Is very beautiful, your car.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You thought any more about our murder?
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Buddy Deeds--
If you spent a little more time training them--
Why would I want to go there?
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Yeah?
Three months.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
So I've heard--
Well, you were working there--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Something wrong?
Got him here?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
Pilar--
Pilar--
The Republicans?
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Yeah.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Yeah. It's quiet--
Sure.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
I know you?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Mister D'Amour?
Who?
You heard right.
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
About?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
What is he?
Did your husband know Quaid?
What's the connection?
I don't know where you'd start.
It's okay.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Are you sure?
...yes?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
What about me?
Trickery and divinity.
So could you walk on water?
Mr. D'Amour?
What are you, my mother?
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Are you sure?
Why'd you come here?
Yeah, I know.
Leave her alone --
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Yes.
Yes.
Was that Swann's idea?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I want to see Swann face to face.
What about?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
I only wear ties for funerals.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Didn't know you read minds.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Of course.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
No, you smiled.
No, yes, it does...
Four.
Nice one.
Yes.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
Hello?
Oh, come on.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hospital?
Sure.
Like popcorn?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
I missed you.
You never said anything to me...
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Yeah, like...
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Claire...
Must be a spare set.
What time did you make it for?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Father, I'm right here.
Well I know he's come here before.
You just call?
Two negatives always make a positive.
May I help you?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
I don't understand what's going on.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
When's your birthday?
No oxygen to the brain.
He was trying to tell me something.
Oh, Peter.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
There weren't any voices.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
What's the matter with you?
How're you doin' today?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
I hate it.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Coach...
What?
Nah.
Mom's going to hate it.
No.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
You were trying to make me look bad.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Well, what do you know.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
I never knew a girl that could play.
I don't care.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Oh.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Guess not.
What?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Sorry about your game.
Nobody.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Least she had time for me.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
We won the championship.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
You visiting?
So...how's the knee?
Getting there.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Cause I don't get it.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
One game.  One-on-one.
Hey.
Give it yourself.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Where's your dad?
Later when?
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Lucky kid.
Your teeth are straight.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
My mother had breast cancer.
Don't sit down.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Wilson.
What?
Did you hear what I said?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
What are you lookin' for?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Bit messy.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Well I don't go out very much.
No, no.
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
ok.
Can I tell you something?
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I lost my gun.
You don't know how crazy I am.
I've got troubles.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
What?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
please, what is it, please --
What's your name?
-- can I get you?
Diet Coke.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
DAD --
It's ok --
How much you pay me for my help?
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
This sounds threatening.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Yeah.
...ah...
She loves you.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
Who are you gonna call?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
Graduation?
Twelve.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Let's talk about --
I would just want to clear some things up:
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Are you asking me that?
Around here.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
I AM CALM.
No one else in here?
And what about screaming?
I went out last night.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
You on any medication?
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Do you have any children with anyone?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
She's asleep.
I'm Bob.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Mmm.Hmmm.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
C'mon, man.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
..sorry...
....Why does he do it...?
This happens....this is something that happens.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
He is your brother!
Your Majesty...
It can.  I know the way.
What is that?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
And people close to him, who --
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
Go on.
Hang himself?!
We must stop him!
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Aramis, this will never --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
No!  Stop --
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Forgiveness.
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Thanks, but not for me.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Get out of my way.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
What is that?
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
... You knew you had a double?
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
Phillippe!
Food, moron.
What number, on the first page?
Raoul... is in love...
I... we are humble people...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Shall I leave?
It's Marvosa -
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
What?  Wait a minute -
Who is it?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
What's going on here?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Yeah.
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No...
I killed them.
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
Both at the same bank...
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
What about him?
That's when it happened?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
How long do I have?
Read it.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
How much do you know?
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Is it weird?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
What's it narrow down to?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
He's a very shy boy...
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
It's not over yet.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
Where the hell's Graham!
Not yet.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
Reba...
I'll see you later. All right?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
Hi, Linda. ..
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
I don't understand.
Why do you think I called?
He's right-handed.
What's average?
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
At the store. You doin' some good?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
Go on to the house.
Are you George Sherman?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
You went in the apartment?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
You read about it, I'm sure.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You're insane.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
I want your opinion.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Cue the commercial!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Have you told your family?
How can you be so casual??!
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Each show is worse than the next.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
You don't know.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Who is it?
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
What are you doing?
I got a fibrillation!
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Morpheus...
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
But what if...?
No.
What are you doing?
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Do you understand, Neo?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
Why?
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Got it.
Who?
What is the Matrix?
From what?
Why?
Uh-oh...
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
What are you doing?
Can you fly that thing.
Where is it?
How?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Neo, this has to be done!
We need an exit!
Operator.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
No.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
So?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
No.
What pipes?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
Nope...
Chinese food?
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Well...
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Don't count it...it's all there.
Count it.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Yeah.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Of course.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Oh, the goddam party --
Do they, m'dear?
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
I thought you were buying my company.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
May I interrupting?
Who are we talking about?
I'm not stepping anywhere --
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
What do you mean?
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
Mind if I throw up?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
You get not to go to jail.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Obeah.
Don' be facety, woman.
Yes.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
I am Joe.
Do you love Drew?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
And is your heart beating strangely?
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
I believe that, don't you?
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Not at all.
Bill --
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
That's what everybody says.
What do you mean?
No.
Are you sad, Bill?
Why did you go to the hospital?
You tell me, Bill.
I'm sorry, Bill --
That's okay.
What's okay?
I think you heard me, Bill.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I told you to shut up.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Yes.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
I think you know --
Please.  Talk to me --
'Take me'...?  Where?
Time.
Watch it!
How's that, Quince?
Next week?
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
So what's wrong with that?
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Where's Joe?
I don't know, I can't say --
What was that?
So you're a one-girl guy?
I could be her.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
Did I say something wrong?
79.
66.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Amnesia?
Couple days.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This isn't my room?
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Yeah, I remember you.
You don't remember me.
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Deals?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
What happened?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What do the police think?
On the house.
My wife.
There's a dress code?
My name's Leonard.							 *
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
I enjoy it.
You said you were leaving town.
Things change.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Why?
How'd you know I was in here?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
My wife wasn't diabetic.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
It is now.
What cop?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
What do you think?
Yes you do...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Okay.
Havana.
Where's she now?
Your father?
I insist.
Like...?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Good samba dancing...?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Where would I go?
I know.  And now?
You afraid of violence?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
Stevens?
Where the hell are you, man?
Where'd you go?
Okay.  What's up?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Out of...?
Where's Riccardo?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Define small.
Conveyance?
You set this up!
Meaning...?
Equipment?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
I can tell, can't you?
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
What's in your socks?
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
What?
Yessir, I can see that.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
What?
Dad...I'm...
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Yes...?
That doesn't seem so bad.
He wasn't even in the car?
How long?
You got your stuff?
What?
Whose?
Know what?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
That's a great philosophy.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Look, I showed you my badge...
What?
Can we get this car there?
He's special.
Which way?
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
No, Jesus, no.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
Oh, my!
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
You want to read it?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
The Sistine Chapel?
I know how that can be.
Perfect.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
Yes.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
No, just the paper will be fine.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
You don't know?
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
You really think Sheldon's out there?
They're hauling Misery into court.
Yes.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
To win?
Sort it all out.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Uh-huh.
I wouldn't do that.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Listen to what?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
They've got a book for this?
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Much.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Something else?
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Luther, say again.
Do I?
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Krieger.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
You were in the car!
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
The message is for Job.
You're sure about this?
We did what we had to do.
What are you going to do?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
This stuff is so sticky.
Are you damaged?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
On what?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
What about Job?
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
He won't be back in a hurry?
Abort.  Thatís an order.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Whatís going to make him do that?
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
What's going on?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Connection denied.
I have no money!
I won't pay for nothing.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're welcome.
What killed him?
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
I got it done.
You're my father.
Oh, Cosmo!
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Have you come from my brother?
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
I like it well done.
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Son of a bitch!
I've never seen a moon like that.
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
I'll come to the wedding.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Who painted that?
Kinda gaudy.
So. Where are we sitting?
What's the matter?
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
I'm here!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Why not?
You've gotta get outta here.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
Maybe you're right.
What's the matter?
Will you marry me?
What do you mean?
This is a good suit.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Yeah.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Who is he?
Where you been?
A wife knows.
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
He's with his dying mother!
WHAT!! She was dying!
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
He should pay.
I don't know.
Moving in?
So.
Where is she?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Can I get another one of these?
Do you have a girlfriend?
I'm a housewife.
Go ahead.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
It's Cosmo's moon.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
You're a liar.
You're a looney.
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
There.
It is the rabbit.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
That's easy!
To seek the Grail!
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Gosh - Is he all right?
But, Mother ...
But, Father.
I was saved at the last minute.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Well, look er, I ...
Well ...
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
They're all saying the word ...
So?
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
I'm getting dressed.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm flattered you think so.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
That can wait till the weekend.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What do you know about the Highlands?
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You're injured.
For Her Majesty.
They aren't as watchful as you.
The greasy pole.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
You are well?
Yes, ma'am.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
What does he know about the Highlands?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Then they may read about me.
So?
Cold is good!
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Please make sure it does not happen again.
I have no idea.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
He?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
It's the game, ARCADE.
Has anyone seen Greg?
What's her problem?
So where is he?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
No, in person.  Now.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
What?
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Then where do we go?!
You mean we learn the rules...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Yes I am...
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
What is it?
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
I know.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Go for it.
Then we'll go home?
What did he do to you?
Is that your question?
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Cynthia...what's going on?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
You gotta be kidding?
So what's the problem?
Whatever.
Okay, I'm thinking.
So, what did they say?
Are you okay?
Very pleased to meet you.
What?
Can you tell me what happened?
What is it Rita?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
No. Just the coffee.
I'm not sure about this.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
No... but...
But I want to.
To my audition.
Yes, Sir.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
No.  I haven't seen any.
No...
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
I'm listening.
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Be very, very quiet...
Stop the hydraulics.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
So ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
What did you hear ?
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Not now, Mom.
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
How did you know my name?
Don't mention it.
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Was it a nice funeral?
What does that mean?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
How about a nice glass of milk?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
You are?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....

It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
He likes you.
Hi.
Is it okay if I drink this?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Thanks
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
You are weird. Let's just go.
Boyfriend?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Just give it to me!!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
In the tar??
Never heard of her.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Like what?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Write me a poem?
What's it for?
You're a good man Nicholas.
Committed?
A secret, I like that.
This is it I guess.
There's plenty of fruit.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
So what's wrong?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Why not now?
He's a great poet.
Wanna play?
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Of what??
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
I think it's still available.
Harry, I really think she.....
Hi.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
What are you wearing?
Do you want to?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Dad?
Dad?
Are they ready yet?
What are you doing.
He's okay isn't he?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cause she's dying.
Do you like her?
Big Ringo fan.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
No.
The boys at school don't think I am.
I won, I won!!!
Where's Daddy?
I knew he wouldn't come.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
What?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
I am not.
Go???
THIS!! 
So?
You're right, let's knock it down.
I do, she's real funny.
Then go home, baby.
Close your eyes.
You better not either.
Would you think of me?
Needs salt.
Kindred spirits.
You think...
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
But he sure can kiss.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
And you think he's kept this to himself.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
You're not eating.
I never eat when I'm serene.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Michael? What ha...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
Does that make it right...
... yeah, that.
Why would she come here...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
What is that sup...
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
You got the money?
I hate that music.
You're from out of town?
Is there food?
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Barnett, please -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Am I disturbing you?
His Word.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Who the hell is he?
It's on National television, Barnett.
How much?
D.C.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
She's in Paris.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Well, Mr. Green.
Hi, Sherry.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
How do you know?
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
Nash.
Mom?
I don't know his first name.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
How long have you been with them?
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I have to go.
I have to go. He sighs.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Yea.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
What do you think of him?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Where are you from?
Ryan O'Neal.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Mickey!
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
How is it?
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Sure.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
And a snake-eye glare.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
That's my opinion.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
How 'bout Mallory?
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
I see.
And me.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Where' you goin'?
'You Duff Anderson?
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
What d'you think?
Have anything in mind?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
That's why you come back, huh?
But I would like to see you again.
I wouldn't have let you.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Are you married?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
How did it go?
Okay, I guess.
Well, what d'you think?
What about him?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
I don't want to hurt you.
Huh?
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Just get her drunk.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
See you, Duff.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
I heard you.
No, thanks.
Seems a little loose!
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Come back some other time, will you?
Come on, Pop.
No, they won't.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I know.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Since when?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
Ghost a steppin' razor...
What does this have to do with me?
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
And then?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
Are you even really alive?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Ready?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
What?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Can you take me to it?
Bright enough to be dangerous.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
We got problems topside.
Case.
I thought you already left.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
And Linda...
Why should I want to meet him.
What is it?
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Something exotic I hope.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Well, do you?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
No Roger from op/ed?
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Bridgework?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Do I want to be crunched?
Five-- Six--
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You've done five of my ideas.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
And a gymnast!
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
You ruined the whole thing!
By name.
Not at all!
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
I'll kill you now.
So, you live around here.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
I'm sorry...
You're fucked in the head.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Are you okay.
What's all this.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What's so funny?
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
Yor dad picking the music again?
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
What?
Can't it wait till morning?
Wait and see.
Horseshit.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I used to live in this house.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
What?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Tell me about the kids.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call me Nancy.
This is nice.
Never been here before?
That's what I know.
With Hypnocyl?
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
I've heard crazier things this week.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
This is stupid.
C'mon.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Wait a minute.  What about me?
Films mainly.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Really?
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
No thanks.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
What did you say?
No, I didn't.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Can I stay a bit longer?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Is that right?
The movie star?
No.  Not true...
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
What do you think?  Good move?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
I did.
Topol.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
You haven't slept with her, have you?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
No, sir.
No, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Spike.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
On this ward?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
A bus?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Yeah...
In there.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Yeah, Mack?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Yeah, where we going?
Neither do I...
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Okay, sucker.
What for?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Yeah, buddy?
Bet a nickel!
Gimme the ball!
Yeah, it's cold!
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
You bet, Doc!
'Kay!
Yeah, buddy?
Because I quit breathing.
What's going on?
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
Yeah...
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Hit me!
Big man!
I'm sure you will.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
I thought so.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
So, what's the story with your friend?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Were they pen pals?
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
Yes.  We did.
No.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You're limping.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I know the feeling.
You aren't?
Well.  Congratulations.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
I can't believe you did that!
Been here long?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Wait.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Is he gay?
You don't have any idea?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
What about your job?
You okay?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
A phone message.  Only--
Your brother?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
I meant about my idea.
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Peter found him?
And Larry?...
A porco?
It's siesta.
Giovanni.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Yeah--
Good strategy.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mm—hmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
Which side are you with?
Man, you were a mess!
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
That was nice of you.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
The things that go on.
Wham... .
Terry!
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
His— racket?
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
What are you crying for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I don't rate it.
Terry, no, no... .
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Good luck.
Mind your own business, Father.
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Such as what?
I'm just resting my feet.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Looking for me?
Take it easy now, Terry.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Terry?  What do you want?
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Not a dent.  Perfect
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
You want to know somethin'—?
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
If I could get my hands on you...
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then..then what's that music?
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
The ropes are coming loose.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You do?
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
What kind of symbol?
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Oh, if there is only time!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yes.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Ask him his name.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
You know they gonna set us up.
They found the safe.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
I bet.  How much?
Let's go outside and talk.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
If I could have a little more room.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
You like bourbon?
Is that how you think of yourself?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
You really wear that suit.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
You getting serious on me now?
If you don't, one of those guys will.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Okay.  How many going out?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Really?
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
What's to think about?
You goin' right back to work?
The <u>ninth</u>?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You're not my type.
What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for Maurice.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
It's a --
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's about to.
What're you doing at Glades?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I didn't have time.
So?
You gonna go get him?
You here all by yourself?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
You mean hiding them?
I wish she could forget him.
Nervous?
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Land of the free...
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Nah, you go on.
Yeah.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
How come you're not pukin'?
Where are we going?
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
I heard what you did.
How often you fight like this?
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
How did you?...
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
What if the Japanese did invade?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
I'll call you Later.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
You drive like a maniac!
Refresh my memory.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, how are you?
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Come back to me.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Terry! Slow down.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Is that one of your poems?
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Hi, Dad.
I closed my Christmas club.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
When did you start drinking coffee?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
And the butter.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Am I dead or not?
Richard, take it easy.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Like what?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
Yes... why?
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
What did?
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
What in God's name... ?
K-R-O-one.
This time. What about next time?
You're going to the office?!
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Take it easy, Walter.
Innocuous?
Little baby girl.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Continue.
Nine.
My lover and I.
I buy that.
Thanks for your time.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
One more thing, Your Honor...
We're friends of Beckett's.
You survived your first gay party intact.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Particularly, Charles.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
What do you love about it?
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Something like that.
What kind of movies do they show there?
In some situations.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Where's Dad?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
A homosexual encounter.
We won.
Good school. What year?
Joe?
Yeah... ?
Going on... like...?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
What whispers?
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Why, what'd you hear?
Had it with deals.
What do you see? Riddick?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Don't do this to me....
You barely know them.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Like what?
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
I never said I was.
So you noticed too?
This does not help us, Johns.
We cannot go through there....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Owens!
You know who Muhammad was?
One is all?
Hasan?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
What're you doin'?
Suleiman!
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Well, you got the big gauge.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Said "looks clear."
Not if I'm the one.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
So which one caught your eye?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Seal the cave?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Well, maybe they're not.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
long pause) You know it.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Don't bother
But I'm not prepared to die.
Scarecrows?
No cigar.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Why special?
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Sustained.
No.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Shhhh!
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Like you, I find it difficult.
He doesn't know.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Fuck you bitch.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Feel good?
I volunteered.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Nah...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
No thanks?

If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Immigration Officer?
They might think I was running away from something.
I didn't say anything.
Do you think I don't?
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Nice of him.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
Bad?
Quarter after one. Why?
Dance? Tonight?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
All right--following me.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
Do you have to leave the note?
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Wonder what?
Including Killaine.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
You-killed-him?
Mine?
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Ale. I don't mind.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
You understand perfectly.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
Sometimes.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Got it on you?
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
What's this in favor of?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
How about a cup of coffee?
How are you two getting along?
I don't.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I never notice the view after the first week.
The only answer I have for you.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Mr. Mitchell.
What are you doing here?
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Send that?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
Open it and count it.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I'll know when I find it.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Well.  What about it?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
And if you didn't believe me?
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Ye have, have ye?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Thank you.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Attributed?
Of course.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
Can I give you a lift?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
Might?
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
The torture of small children--
Yes, finally.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Why not sit down and wait?
What about the Cromwells?
Dad.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Don't you gamble?
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
You're a fucking dead man--
Three seconds... two... one...
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
They're on their way to Maui.
Meaning you were expendable.
What are you talking about?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
You had enough?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Who cares!
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
What in God's name...?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
We can reach an understanding on this.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Storage, I think.
Who are you going after next, sir?
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Nice car.  Yours?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Off the boulevard.
Do you plan everything?
Try a strawberry.
Just a romantic, that's you.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
I buy companies.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
What id we run into someone I know?
Real genuine guy.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I've never been on a plane before.
But don't they have it in English?
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I got tired of hating my father.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
I'm here.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
But, Edward...
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
I don't think it would fit you.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
He knows I do not love him.
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
But what if something happens to you?
But how can you be sure?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Why is that, do you think?
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
What?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
-hold it, hold it-
Because I can stop now if you want.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Westley's only faking, right?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
What? What?
He's already dead.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Humiliations galore!
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Tell me.
Get used to disappointment.
Making sure nobody's following us.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Let me explain-
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
I accept.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Mr. Bialystock ...
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
You're going to jump on me.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Bismark...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
We won.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
I live there. Alone.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Who are you, friend?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
Of course not. Please.
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Did he say anything about my sister?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Huh?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Does that mean we can't...
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Where'd you go to college?
You going to wait here for me?
What makes you sound so certain?
Hospital clean.
What?
Sam. This is the last time.
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
You have something most girls never have.
I've caused you some trouble.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Why do you ask that?
Crane.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Why?
Oh?
Maybe you saw Mary!
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Recluse. Kinder word.
I'll take you to...
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Did I?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Did you hear?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
Yes, why?
Why didn't you eat last night?
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
No kiddin'.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
You're insane.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
I'd know him anywhere.
I'm heading out of town.
Where to?
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
What'd you do, Rose?
You were pretty bad, huh?
What did you expect?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Am I hurting you?
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Open that door, damn you!
There goes Mother.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
So am I.
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Why is it taking so long?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
What?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
No reason at all, darlin'.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
You mean a farm?
I don't believe it.
Galley what?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Now you know what to watch for...
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
I'm just saying...
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Name one.
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
No, we're stealing.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
You know what I mean.
We got him.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
I'm gonna get beside him.
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You suck at lying, Archie.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
You see that?
This shit was Ming.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Yes, my Master.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Someone who loves you.
I...
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Yes.
We shall double our efforts.
Ugh!
Tell me.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
How many languages do you speak?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Uh huh.
I'm coming with you.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Brad...
Maybe we could try it this way.
You're OK by me.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Now I
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
Looks quiet, y'know.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
Yes, I do.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
I always knew you was pretty.
Don't you open them anymore?
...Like you?
It's not your house --
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
My side.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Don't like yours neither.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
That's ten bucks.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Black market?
Rocky.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Make your teeth yella --
Listen, I hope ya don't --
I said, how ya feelin'?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Rice is a bum.
Ya puttin' me on?
Here's the card?
'Bout an hour ago.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
It ain't your locker no more.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
...What kinda dog is this again?
What?
Hey --
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
He's takin' cheap shots.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
He's a riot.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
What was <u>that</u>?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Toon cops worked me over.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Have you got the will?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
A Toon?  Noooo.
No better?
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
A challenge, on my life.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Every man betake him to his legs.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
[Within] Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Well what shall I swear by?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Pink for flower.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Of course.
Well I don't!
What is?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Lose them!
About time!
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
Now, what did we steal?
Are you alright?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Sent it where?
Gregor, is that you?
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
American.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
I wanted to see who you were.
Lovely, isn't it?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I borrowed that, too...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
Do what?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I'm not here very much.
No you don't, and you know it.
Just like that?
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Why's that?
Why didn't you kill her?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Can you get it?
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Damn.
Ready to roll, partner?
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Seven thousand...
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Why?
What makes you so sure?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
I don't know...
That's not what I mean.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Well what are we supposed to do?
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Then we're screwed.
Oh Jesus...
What are you talking about?
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Two thousand...
Just take it in stride.
Yeah?  So?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
A satellite dish?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
And what's that?
Why?
What makes you say that?
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Have you known this all along?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Are you hungry?
That's great Earl!
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
There was more than that.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
How much is that?
Invitation, please.
So tell me what you know.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
So what's your story?
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
No.  It's my first time.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
No.  She's a school teacher.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Why LA?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
No.  It was my singing.
What's she doing?
Get it out of here!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
She saved our lives.
What's a Chinese heaven?
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
What is Mac out?
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
I did!
Ricky Tan is alive.
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
You move well.
Baby Duck?
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
What is your name?
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
You talk very fast.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Witnesses.
It was not my intent --
What plate?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
You like it?
No, fish is a PM food.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
What?
You're killin' me here.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
How'd what go?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
How about a lift home?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Johnson...
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You a cop or something?
Nobody touches me.
Hello.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
I am so sorry about your men.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Right.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
We do it to our dog.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Thanks.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Thank you.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Maybe someday.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
Highly suspect.
No.
Of course.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Yes I do!
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Yes, I did.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I'm going to kill myself.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Is that all right with you?
I'll wait.
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
And then I'll see you in New York --
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Turn on your radio!
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
No, I'm not. 
What are your plans in New York?
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
A sense of humor.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
Are you Annie?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Have you had any relationship since?
You don't like the one he was now?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Write her.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
So I can go.
Stressed.
How did they get our phone number?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Somewhere in the middle.
-- a slice of pizza --
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
What do you think?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
It was sinking.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Is that what she used to sing?
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
What are you doing up?
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Was Mom an adjustment?
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.
Do you like baseball?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Do you like it?
You look good.
You could have called me --
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
They are singing for me.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Can be what?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
When?
Sun up.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Like what?
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Luís! Come down here!
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
No.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Oh. Hi.
: What are you up to?
What do you want from me, Colette?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
What time is it?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
You wanna score some go-fast?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Was he the president?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Crank or glass?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Cool it. We got business.
You got a name?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Please ... don't do this ...
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
He's the only one I told.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
What do you mean?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Where's Bubba?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Sir?
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Yep.
That must be four thousand yards.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
It's worth it.
A half-track, anything.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
Senator's son?
But you could have gotten killed and I...
You know classical music?
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
What'd you say, Captain?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
How about...?
You alright?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Up.  We're moving out.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Goddamn it!
I'd like to go, sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
So, where are you from?
Hey, sis.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
I'll be in my office.
But you never had a first date.
I'm gonna call her.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Hang in there, man.
Did you sleep with her?
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
What are you doing?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Dad, are you okay in there?
What happened to you?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Well...
Would you hold this for me?
Thank-you.
Have a good sleep.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Nobody knew me before tonight.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah.
Am I wrecking my car?
You're shaking.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
We decided...
What do you want?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
It's your castle, man.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Just her name.
Oh boy.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
We're full on bonded.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
What's your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
You know what, you'd like her.
Should I stay?
Should I stay?
You want these people.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
Yeah.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
What others?
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
I got to go, I'll see you.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I'll talk to him.
That's very generous of you.
They're withholding payment.
Can't we hold him?
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
What is it?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
That's too bad.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Tons and tons.
But you’ll never get away with it.
I could use some therapy.
Where's Sid?
About what?
Go on, untie him.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
She's got guards with her.
He seemed harmless.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
You broke my heart.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Who are you?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
It's good to see you involved.
Are you in danger now?
Where is your attacker?
Gotta.
That was good.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Do you want to die?
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
What do you want?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Do you work for her now?
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Who?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Detective Kincaid?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
They've got her!
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
What about me?
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Need to get in that building?
Nobody said she was an actor.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Let's get out of here!
Hello.
But you know my favorite name?
W-what do you want?
How do I know their voices are --
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Jesus, SHIT!
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Who are you trying to reach?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
What did you say?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Sure...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I wanna play a game.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Come on, yes you do.
No it's not. It was Jason.
You tricked me...
...leave me alone... please...
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Sidney's father?
Does mom know?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Have you contacted the bureau?
What is it? Where's Casey?
Where is she?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
And why would she do that?
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
So what's his reason?
The official term is "psychotic".
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
It's always been like this.
What do you mean?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
We would have gotten you eventually.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I... I don't follow.
You just met me.
Is there any blood in it?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
You go to movies at least?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
What?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
And?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
I'm fine.
We need a warrant.
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
We could use about fifty more men here.
He's preaching.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
Kiss me on the lips.
I don't know why... why now?
This painting...
Oh... um, William.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Did the wife confess?
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
Another one, eh?
Dunno...Seems so.
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
What in...?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
That's what I said.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Easy on that!
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
That don't make 'em kin...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
I think maybe we oughta...
Ethan, quit it!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I got your boy killed.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
You?
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
What?
She was old.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
I've killed my husband!
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Twenty-three, to be exact.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
You have the last act?
Tomorrow.
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
I have a wonderful new play!
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Is it going well?
Very well.
It is over.
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
How will it?
What do we do now?
Burbage says you have a play.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
And yours?
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Two hours at prayer!
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Verona again.
Your Majesty.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
What do you love so much?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
"Madam!"
"Madam!"
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
I have lost my gift.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
There is.
Oh, do not go
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
Orsino…good name
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Good morning, my lord!
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Wait there.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
But what of Lord Wessex?
Is there a man?
A man, my lord?
What?
I'm only asking what you think.
Come on, David.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Nothing.
Not eating what?
Your friends.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
What?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
What?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
I'm not usually drunk.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Be careful.
What's he doing here?
No.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
It tastes different.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Oh, good.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred pounds?
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
What do we do here, David?
Eh --
It's nice.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
No. I haven't seen them.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
My keys.
Why not?
She did?
I'll be back in a while.
-- What?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
What about?
Oh, no.
Okay.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Chopped liver?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I'm sure.
-- Well no. It never came up.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
Great.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
It'll ruin everything.
What are you talking about?
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Sammy's?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
What's that supposed to mean?
God, there's Lester...
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
I have to see you.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
You're different.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Go where?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Okay.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
When is that?
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
That was him.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
What difference does it make?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
How?
What? What? What? What? What?
George...
You need a cut.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Oh yeah?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
... this doing hair it's...
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
This really ought to be layered...
I wanna hear about it, George.
No thanks.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
What about her?
No --
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Yes I do.
Okay.
A daytime soap opera.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Jackie Shawn.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Fine.
Well, he is.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Well, it's George.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
Well, there was this one time --
What did you do?
Good for you.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Jill.
No... how long did you say?
Do you have children?
Are you married?
Do you have something against traveling?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
I'm not supposed to.
Who's Tony?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
What about Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay...oh!
It's so pretty.
Yes?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Why not?
It's okay, really.
Advocaat is it?
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Sure.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yes.
I...
Stay away from me.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
five months of peace is just what I want.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
I'd better collect my family first.
Hi.
Eight thirty.
Can I tell you kids something?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Mom-!
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
Oh?
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
Perhaps.
He's... dreamy.  He's...
SING!
Were you tempted?
SING!
And you listen to that?
What?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
I know.  It's ancient.
It's true -- I know her.
Shirelles.
A cigarette?
Excuse me?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
I'm getting experience.
What?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Really catching on.
No.  No.
But... wait a minute...
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
He's a businessman.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
What'd she say?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Who are you guys?
Neither did you!
A sweater.
It should be here any minute.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Peace on Earth.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
An... entertainer?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Reverend Mother?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Stains of blood.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Do you have these persons' wills?
May we look at them now?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
What is it?
We should go.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
This is farewell.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
I insist that you have it.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
My God... what has happened?
It was you there?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Katrina...
No.  She has gone out.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
I know you saw me.
There was not much blood, was there?
What did you say?
You are from the Hollow?
You got any money?
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Can I help you?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
What do you like to eat here?
French-fried potaters.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Leave.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
What's you last name?
Don't you live somewhere?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Did you want to play ball with us?
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
Why not? It died?
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
You don't want to give away all your books.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I never was no good with history.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
What brings you back?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
Yes sir.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Like me, too.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Not an easy book.
What's the difference?
The Queen of England?
Yeah, I did.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
So what did he say when he called?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Two, right?
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Anything good?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Where to?
You what?
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
So I can get my job back.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Does it hurt?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
What are you talking about?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I mean breakfast.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Celebrate? What for?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
I don't know.
Is it yours?
Good thinking.
I'm not going to do it.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Is that your third question?
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
Did you say more?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
Still lashed to the mast.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Why?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
I'll say.
But suppose it doesn't?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
You've flipped your wig!
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Now you've done it!
This way, Daphne.
Down, Daphne!
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Have I got things to tell you!
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Like what?
That's some nerve!
Get me Room 414.
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Did you hear that?
She sings, too.
Are my seams straight?
Good night, honey.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
Not you, Sugar.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Yeah - Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
What for?
How did you get that bracelet?
I always did.
Where did you girls play before?
I was it.
Help yourself.
Most of the time I slap it.
This is where I get off.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
I don't care.
I forgive you.
We'll adopt some.
What's the job?
And you'll be in all evening?
It's not the backs that worry me.
No, we couldn't!
Oh.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Rough?
Yeah.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Why not?
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
What makes you so sure?
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
You're society girls?
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Nothing at all?
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
You poor, poor boy.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you do me a favor?
I think you're on the right track.
Good night.
Good morning.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
I never join nothin'.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Huh?
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
What’s going on with you two?
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I had to say something to get you here.
No, tell me.
That was a long time ago.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Hi. Hey.
Mission accomplished.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
It’s cute.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
I guess so.
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
Subtle?
What?
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
Hi.
Like fifteen.
Dad!
“Not yet...”
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
It's cold, Daddy!
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
From Miss Johnson --
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
You got two shirts on?
Who is they?
Did you see Daddy?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
What's wrong with him, David?
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I wanta get some things.
Tired.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
Mornin'...
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Help yourself prickfuck!
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Hello there, children!!
Hey, Chef.
Mrph?
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Uhh... I don't know.
That was sweet!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
What did you do today Satan?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Hi Wendy.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
You didn't?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
We don't.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Sure.
What's that?
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Take this flare.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
I'm not going with you.
But how are you going to escape?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Will you marry me?
What is it?!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
No, just enjoying the view.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
I guess so.
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
You a mini-golfer?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
100 years! 
Grace Skinner.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
What's it look like to you?
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
You shouldn't touch her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
What did you do to Buzz?
Who's there?
Junior.
How Mr. Kastle?
Where's Junior?
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
He's not here.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Where can I find him?
What's your specialty?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Mind if I cut in?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
No, I'm fascinated.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Sheila, please.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
You're really pissing me off.
Sez you!
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Get out of there!
Nobody move.
What was that?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Maybe older --
It doesn't make any sense.
I don't know.  That's the point.
You don't want to know.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
You think he killed Edmunds?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
What's the message?
Ted, get her away from the door.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
I love secrets.
You're next, Norman.
My gosh, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
The refridgerator.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
You think?
You don't believe me.
What?
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
You think, in the sphere --
It's for motion sickness.
Sintag.
Doesn't say.
For what?
Not believing you.
What do you mean, different?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
It's getting cold.
Are you manifesting them?
That's when you went in the sphere.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Then where's it coming from?
Stop it!
Hear what?
Well, what's your theory?
I never said that.
How are you feeling, Norman?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Did I?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What happened to her?
She's cracking, Norman.
But why would she -- ?
Fine.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
You mean forget?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
But it's impossible.
Think about it.
What'd you say?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Who's everyone?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
I don't know.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
You saw through me?
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
You mean I generate an energy field?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
Who's the pilot?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Why didn't you say so before.
Get to the ship!
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
No need, everything's under control.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
It's what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
How do you make him do that ?
Please continue, Sergeant.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Good for you.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Are you the boy for me ?
Who cares ?
Should I be ?
What's wrong with you ?
That was just a mix up.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Disclose the information.
They have repressed the Creator.
<U>Answer</U>!
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Granted.
<U>Computer off</U>!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Twelve seconds...!
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Child...!?
You bringing your new friend?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
Why did you quit?
Yes.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
But, but but but...
That: in an act of...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Everyday things...yes.
...who...?
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
What?
It's for your finger.
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Why?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
What?
Gosh, you look nice.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Not without a rolltop desk.
But it'll stop the movie.
Water or mineral deposits.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I wasn't doing business.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
...why am I here...?
That's right.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
I loved it...he...
Mornin, sister.
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
What do you drink?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I'm very sorry to...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
But not that <u>way</u>...
I just...
I can't do it, Walt.
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
I...I...
...I know...I know...
...yes...
I'm only trying to...
...yes...
Who got their heads cut?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Why?
He told you that...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
I had a witness I would.
I...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
I know you do.
You can't write it?
How do they know that, you told them?
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
<u>Stop</u>...
Yeah?
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...it is?
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
...the damn thing...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Mass hysteria.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
That happens.  To families.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
I can't hear you.
I could help with the debate.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'm not.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Excuse me --
Poof!  You're happy now.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
No.
Mommy's sick, guys.
Rache says it's from you.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
Not to me.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
Still, please.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
To make it easier for them or you?
WE are over.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
What did you do?
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
So why did y...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
She's devastated.
Can I look at the pictures?
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Is that what he told you?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
That's not wh...
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Why didn't I?
You'll learn.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Don't ever say that.
You heard me: leave the table!
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Yes, Mikey?
Really? How many?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
How did they execute him?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
No, you don't.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
What are you going to do?
What DO you know?
So? How was school today?
Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Gee, you're home early!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
That's good.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
No, not really.
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Great!
But...you called.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
How many?
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
I know.
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
You want some?
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Can I see what you have so far?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Is he with the girl?
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
What happened?
What are you talking about?
Well Filmore--
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
Who's Ryan Cooper?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
If I don't get power up we are!
Get your men to do it!
What does that mean?
Yes?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
That's right, fella.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
General Schmuck?
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Yes?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Who do you think you're talking to?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
That is correct, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
How many planes did we lose?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Then this is it.
Check.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
I think they mean business.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Shoot, Lothar.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Primary bomb is live.
He's dead.
Recall what mistake?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Was it okay?
Slides go with it.
Typical male.
Yup.
Any gunshot victims?
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Okay, okay.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Y- s-sure it did.
Look.
Buff...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
No.
Ah, you know people there?
So, how was the ride, kids?
Sure I am. It's fun.
In what way?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Okay.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
A Porsche.
Mm.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Really?
What was your name again?
Deep down. Way down.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
We were?
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Will you just put the gun down?
Is that Bee-Bee?
What?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
No.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Hey!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Of course.
And?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
Mm-hm.
You're unbelievable.
What?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Yeah.
So you think I should?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
I don't know.
Ready?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Oh, yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah.
I can't believe you're still here.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
You do?
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Whatever.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Don't do that.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
You sure?
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Trix...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
That was gas, Sweetie.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Kansas!
Yeah?
Or, I could get my own horse...
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Roll 'em.
Good party.
I'll take it.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Is there someplace we can talk?
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Into what? A lampshade?
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
It's just impossible.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Hello, Betty.
Come on, Joe.
If you love me, Joe.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
Yes, I did.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I wrote that with my heart.
What month?
You'll like it here.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
What's that?
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
I've lost my car.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Don't bend back like that.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
What's that?
What are the notes?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
They're awful.  They make me cough.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
No, they don't.
Wanted what?
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
I'm not here.
Whose room was this?
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
What does it mean?
I think I'd better keep it.
I don't feel like it right now.
What do you want?
Is this Nigel's doing?
Tell me where I can find her.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
What's that?
But why?
And now?
Before you go...
I did.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Do you have any theories about last night?
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
What's a tree?
I can do that.
There isn't any.
No thanks. You go on.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
I have to talk to you.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
But it's impossible.
You're going to take me back?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Do you really know Superman?
Say!
You're the best, Lois.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
First paycheck?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
And do nothing. Just sit there.
A computer.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
We back in Metropolis?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
I thought you'd never get here.
I don't know you, lady.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Where's the light switch?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
I don't kiss.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Hostages?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
I'll try to remember that . . .
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Genius!  --  Lex.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
Sensible enough.
Shhhhhhh!
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Constantly.
You must be freezing.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Is he for real?
What's that?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
But . . . how could you beat him?
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
I know, but  --
Do you know where you're headed?
Not...gray.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Know what?
Huh?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Jealous? Of what?
Is that what they're calling him?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Damn!  This will get him.
I read the article.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
What do you suggest, my dear?
-- as we will be.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Superman???
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Can you really see through anything?
Where do you hail from?
Is that real enough for you?
It is for me.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
Of time, Luthor.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
We're...not together.
But you said...
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
They can look forward to that.
You believe that?
Because I have to.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Berries.
Berry-picking.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
Anything you didn't understand?
We've only got honey.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Do you have a room?
What do you mean?
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
What do they do?
Crafts?
Daddy?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Yes.
No.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
You remember this?
That was great.
You mean it?
Pretty slick, eh?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Are you sleeping?
Great.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Will the police do anything to her?
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Will you mind your own business!
Is "he" inside?
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Not being partial, are you?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Hello, Harry.
Can I come in for a minute?
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Get Steve back his job...please...
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
This sort of thing!
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
We stick in each others craw.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I tried to reach you twice -
You haven't told him yet...
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Do you know about the chip?
No one must follow your work.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Why do you cry?
Remember what I said, you can't...
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Some.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Five minutes.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Your manner.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
With more what? More what?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Not yet.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You live here, in Berlin?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
What's in those files?
What is this, Emmi?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
Steve Arnold...
I was warned.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Show me.
Show you?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Alright!
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
What do you think?
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
What's that?
Not possible.
Good fighters.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Do you know what to do?
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
Why not?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
If there was one.
I'll wait.
What's C.R.S.?
There goes a thousand dollars.
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
A fresh shirt...
What are you doing here?
Wha... ?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Nicholas...
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Studied acting, I assume?
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
You look good.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Okay.
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Really?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
I'll call.  I really will.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
What gentleman, Maria?
What the fuck... ?!
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Is that the question of compassion or science?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
Are you working with her?
No.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
And then what happened?
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
You know what he's really upset about?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
She needs help.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
David.
David?
Why?
Are you sure?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
What's the matter?
How they goin', kid?
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Been to the Boat Show.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
This ain't your lot?
She didn't write to me, did she.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
What are we standing on?
Too easy?
Again?
Do you have any friends, man?
What post office?
Same.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Why did you come here?
That's not what I heard.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
I see.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
You don't seem bothered.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
Get seven years, did you?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Not that I recall.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Don't you work with Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Yeah?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Yeah.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
How'd you get in here.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
...You are ze fahzer?
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
And how do we share--
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
That'll be fine.
Mm.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Should I... should I tell you why?
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
OK, how did you know?
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
I'm fine.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Frank.
Uh-huh.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
What's left of it.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
This place is a maze.
I hope you liked it.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
What are they?
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
How many storage areas are there?
Yes.
What's that?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
I don't want to go this way.
Not that big.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Is Dr. Frock safe!
How does it work?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
You're not.  Where is it?
Help someone!
What?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
Thank you.
--a dead one at that.
That's correct.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Nothing was real.
I have a map.
Sure she would.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
Marlon--
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Stay where you are!
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What're you doing down here?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
You hate gambling.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, what about that sign?
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Who?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I think you better tell us.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
You've been back to Dallas?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
What's that?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
You know my work?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
How can I reach you?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
What do you think?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
I think they have that covered.
Jesus, Mulder...
Now what?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
All I told them was the truth.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
You're... quitting?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
This looks like new grass to you?
Where would they be going?
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you think it is?
I have. I did. It's done.
I need you on this, Scully --
What? What happened?
Scully...
We've got to keep moving.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
Are we being watched?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
She adores you.
I do it all the time!
Sing a song of sixpence.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
That went well.
Well look at that.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
So?
How is she?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
What else do we do?!
I don't have to.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Ja, ja, ja.
Give her some cigarettes.
Do you understand German?
His own doctor?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Can I hear you?
...is there?
Harry.
His.
Of course.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Yes, of course.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
...to him.
Next, Paine.
I see.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Be sensible, Martins.
Never heard of him.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
...you know and all that.
...you.
Dr. Winkel?
Coming to the point, please.
Hear the details.
Speak English?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Oh, you did.
Funny?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
Third Man.
...this time.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
One or two kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
What!
I'm sorry.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Bonsoir.
Exactly.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
What, do you like it here?
Yes.
Fire...
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Which is what?
What's he care about?
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Who's Linda?
Why won't you talk to me?
What's it mean?
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
What'd you say?
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Notice? Like what...?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Why?
Female...
Those aren't Jews.
Are all Jews the same?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
How do you reconcile the two?
Explain it so I can.
I don't think you know what you are.
How did you...?
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
They're not my people....
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Isn't it true?
Who knows what that is?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Not too fast.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Howard Stern.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Fund-raising??
So what?
Oh, fuck you...
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
I tell you she's mine!
Yes.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Roberto?  How long?
Have the car painted.
The medics are looking all over for you.
Where did you get that?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
And where did you say you were from?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
No, no!
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
That's good.
... I was right about what?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
You look adorable.
Thank you...
Lucky I was there to save you.
Jacques, you set a world record.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
You'll try again tomorrow?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Anything.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Why don't you ask me?
Assassin!
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
What are they for?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Will he understand Spanish?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
What's up?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Hammer, you alright?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
What day is it?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Cut.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Good evening.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
About Charlie's leopard?
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Tormented -- ? Why?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Why?
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Who is he?
I know. Funerals.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
You lost my money?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
I’m really sorry you were not called...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
...You-you spoke to him?
I don’t.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
...We’re turning in circles.
Where is that?
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Get to the point, will you...
What do you suggest?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
What...?
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
Ever seen him before?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
What?
How many of you scumbags are here?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
B-Black...
Where is it?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Good.
Should I?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Okay. Recommended...
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
My rates...
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
What is it?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Fine...
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Gluck.
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Tell me...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Quite a few.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
And when was that?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Am I... am I dead?
God defeated the English, not me.
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Trial?  What trial??
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Many things...
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
... You look wonderful...
Get them out of here!
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Your majesty, I really think you...
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
Not yet.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Do you know how to count?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Why not?  He has good teeth...
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
What have you done to me?
Who... who are you...?
I might ask you the same question.
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Why not?
God asked you to do something?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
You think you are ready now?
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
Yes, it is.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
You can't, it's too dangerous.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Who's recruiting?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
What d'you mean, take the table away?
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Yes, but what good did it do?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
What the hell are you doing?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Well, that is a strong opinion.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
Yes, why not.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You mean in signs?
Hello, then.
And when is the next lesson?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Hackers.
What do ya want the others to get?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Yeh.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You in?
How ya doin'?
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
No.
What does this guy want?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
Hooker!
So could Shaw.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Nothing.
How are you?
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
You're high enough.
No.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Macaulay.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
She... she fell over backwards.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Where are you going?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
And he still wants to marry me!
Shrapnel!
That woman!
Who's is it?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
No.
Who're you calling?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Rosebreen.
Are you kidding?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Who's that man?
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Don't you remember....
I never had it.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
No word at all?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
What do you think?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
So it's you he was after!
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Pretty girl.
She didn't tell me a thing.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
You did.
Who's that?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
You talk as if I were Asta.
Looks like a hold-up!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Not with all your money!
Sure I will.
Back to California
I'm going to tell her.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
I've got a lulu -- why?
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Is that true?
I don't know.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Was he a good detective?
For climbing.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
You ready?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You're the one with all the ideas.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
Oh, that's fun.
They're not going to--
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
How's this going to work?
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
No.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Just let me rest for a second.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Well?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
Jaeger?
Yeah.  So?
At-at-at-at-at.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
HUMMMM.....
What's this?  Why did you change it?
You know I don't feel well.
Don't go.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
It's the end.
THX!
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I've got it!  Astounding!
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
Why did you have LUH come here?
What's going on?
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Remember this...?
No...no you're wrong.
So what were they doing here?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
How long were you hooked?
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Alright!
You okay?
Why are we stopping here?
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
You okay?
T.J., what're you doing?
Yes, sir.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
No!
No.
Yes!
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Nice suit.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I would start with cocktails.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
You say I am a crook.
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Now just a minute, Major--
Two fifty-three, five--
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Yes.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
You like that statue?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
That's too dark.
Do you know my first name?
What?
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Madame.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Good night. 
No--yours, madame.
Yes, I would!
You're conceited--
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
You look beautiful.
Yes, Gaston?
And you expect me to believe that?
I don't believe it!
Giron...!
It could have been marvelous ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
What is it, madame?
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
I beg your pardon!
Then why did you do it?
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Bollocks.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Yes, exactly!
What's this?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Sure. If you like.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Where to, Miss?
You're trembling.
It's bad.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Is your stateroom alright?
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Feeling a little better, I see.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Did you find it?
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
No gentleman would do that.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Isn't she attractive?
Well, I can't.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Sorry.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
You keep it-- 
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Yes, Yes!
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
Come on, you...
Yeah, you look it.
Here, Doc.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
That's great coming from you.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
You really look awful.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
How would you know?
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
I hate Sadie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Forget it, Ringo.
What'd you do that for?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Your new car. 
Do you feel better now?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
I see...
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Blood or Dutch?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
Of course.
Sorry I'm late -
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
You won't get away with this!
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
What did your wife get her?
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Will you still get the money from your father?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
You okay?
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I'm busy.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Harry, you know everything.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
None of your business.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
When did you talk to Harry?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
You can bring ONE toy...
But Mom, I can't find him!
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Yes, I can.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Something's screwy here.
Hey, watch it!
Heh-heh.
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Will you quit moving around?!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Reach for the sky!!
Woody?!
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
I finished it off.
Stop it!
Reprieve.
I already lost everything once.
So did I.
So had I.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
This is different.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
I don't know.
How's David?
How long's the job?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
...How old are you?
Do you work?
What's that mean?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
Are you getting this on tape?
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
What?
An informant.
But will he be house-trained?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
Any way we can do it better?
I want your money, I'll take your money.
You won't say anything to my parents?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
What's your name?
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
So why have you told me about it?
Happy birthday.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What happened?
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
No.
Good luck, Spud.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
But try too hard --
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Four Grand.
Are you serious?
What's on the menu this evening?
Sounds great, Swanney.
Yeah.
This had better be good.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
But the shuttle-
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Because it's there.
I don't understand.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Jim.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
What do you mean?
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
I did not.
The emergency channel, open.
No... I didn't.
The ship needs its Captain.

Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
He's not?
Why not?
I don't understand...
I don't get it.
You invented Space Paranoids?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Hello, Alan.
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
The Pentagon?
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
That was uncalled-for.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
What about our friend - Sark?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
How about you?
How did you do that, Flynn?
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Where are you going?
How was school today?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Station wagon?
Helen's going to be pissed.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Now what?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
My husband is a good man.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
Uh huh.  Okay.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
And you agreed?
Do you still love your husband?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
I think so.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
What were you doing there?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
Yes.
What is it?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Get going! 
Are you sure you weren't followed?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
What is it you want me to do?
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
I don't know.  I have to think...
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Helen.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Sonny kicks ass.
Would you like to get some pie?
Like it?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Where you goin', honey?
What?
What?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Really?
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I'm hip.
Live with what?
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
This is Drexl's coke?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot what?
What's to think about?
Clarence...
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Really?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
What?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
No. Not yet.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I got some money I can give you -
I've seen him.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Or a bit player -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Do you know where we can find him?
Where's that?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
No.
What year is it?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
Mason???
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
Give me the gun.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Germs?!
What...???
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
JOSE!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Uh, that message...me?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
You have him in restraints.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
What do you want for free?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
You don't fear death?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
How much.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Yep.
Time.
Accident.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You've been there?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
I want my car.
You got beer?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
What do you want?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
You didn't hear something?
Jake, what is that?
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Thank you, John.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
You know what I want.
You could just leave him.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
From?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
To get my car.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
I think I busted my leg.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, throw me the keys.
No.  I swear it.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
A lot that means.
What happened to your hand?
What brings you to Sierra?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Would you?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
I did?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Trouble with the car again?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
I came to kill her.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
What?
Got any requests?
She's dead.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Now, what's this?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Jesus!
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
What for?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
No police.
You want something, old man?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
What?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Say, what happened to your hand?
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Would you?
You're talking like a madman.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Next time you'll do just fine.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Oz.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Will he be back soon?
Yep.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Don't look like nothing.
Hundred-fifty.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Are there snakes out here?
Is that why you're with him?
Try me.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Grace ... Grace?
I'm not sailing his boat.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
And I love you too.
Where ya goin'?
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
How much?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Let me get your change.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Wrong number.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Is that the entire message?
How old is Jeb?
I'll keep it in my office room.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Oh shit...
Yes.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Skeptical about what?
In college. A car accident.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
What do you want?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Are you for real?
I thought he was carrying something.
Yes.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
Just one--
No.
No Jeremy.
I'll just shoot him once.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Yeah, hello.
Did you get up from your seat?
How so?
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
What'd he say?
He tell you where them others is?
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
No?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
I could run off them whores.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
What's your name?
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Who killed him?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
You're goin' back with him?
He's in there.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
That was... the first one.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
You ain't like that no more.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Far enough.
More.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Three million?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Waste of time.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
I don't know about that.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Wait a minute.
This is all bullshit.
You think he's..?
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Abrams...
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Four cases in three years ...
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
I know of him.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
What is this going to cost?
Hold on a second.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
And you wrote that...
... and you're going to do that?
Her doctors killed her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
... that's perfectly all right.
No.
Who are you protecting, then?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
Listen to me, fella...
I can't guarantee that...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Pardon?
D'you find an apartment?
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
Laura.
And are they going to get it?
You're talking like a drunk.
I...do you want me to leave?
Who told you that?
Is it over?
I have to talk to you.
...I'm going to need your help...
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...I have to stand up for her...
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Been a long time, huh...?
I'm swell.
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I want to buy you a drink.
It's a long road that has no turning.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
What happened in those three minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
I didn't mean to be that rough.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
You won't have to.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
About three years.
Just dinner.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Mmm.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Tomorrow night? Well --
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Why?!
Will you, Judy?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
You don't even want to touch me.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Why?
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Your accident...
I don't know... Switzerland?
Some money.
Do you remember where you were?
Where were you?
Why?
Where had you been before?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
My name is John Ferguson.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
No.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Vaguely...
Would you know the room?
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
Yes?! But --
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Yes.
No... we're together...
Where?
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Why?
Is there something I can do for you?
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Well?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Could be.
Sorry, old man. Work.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Where?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
How ya doing?
What?
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What do you think you are doing?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Bury her out in the desert.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
So I didn't fucking do it!
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
What does that mean?
What?
At the seven-eleven.
Real times.
I won't do it.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
I got you.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
That's right.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
What's your fucking point?
He's too drunk.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Call 911.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He is not cracking up.
I just want to get married.
That's right.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
False.
And what happens when you can't?
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
Sent it.
What else have you forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
What?
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Take care of those chairs.
Well you should.
I'm working on it.
Don't even.
The prostitute.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
What does that mean?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
You did all right dad.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
I'll take a ride.
The wahoo moment?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
The first day.
Greenpeace?
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
"You Send Me."
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
The post-Vegas Man.
I'll come to you tonight.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Two.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
How did you know about that?
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Yes.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Miss Viridiana ...
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Is she coming back?
No.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Don't talk like that!
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
What about you, Manuel?
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
You think he's smart?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was you, wasn't it?
It was me, what?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
John died.
I don't need a baby—sitter.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
What the hell's going on?!
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
How did you find out about the toxin?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
More or less.
Sid?
Where's John?
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
What can it hurt.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.

But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Yes

We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.

Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...

No, I didn't think so.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
No, I'm fine... I got it together....

No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Keep Talking....

Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
... That's what you told us to say.
He's lying.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
...you take that Anacott Steel?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
What the hell...
What's going on?
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Speak English will ya.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
Don't start, alright.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
So you're hot on this stock?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Okay.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
How do you know?
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
How much is enough Gordon?
Oh yes, I remember you.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Break it.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Businessman!
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
We're all here, and ready sir!
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Can I give her a message?
Tony and China?
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
Well, it all started when a friend and I
No thank you sir we're fine.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Of course you will.
No, he wouldn't.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Are you mad at me?
I miss you.
So much.
What do you mean?
No.  But once I heard...
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Why is he worried?
What's happening to me?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
No.
Yeah.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
...just so she could cut them off.
We were suite mates.
She got it.  Turned it down.
What is it?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
What's their name?
Whatcha reading?
Why?
I just wish you could have heard her.
Oh.
Unless you need me to come home...
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
Get down!  He'll see.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
...like it never even happened...
There we go.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
What are you doing out here?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Who did?
How did you--
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Yep.
You don't remember?
You dropped a glass.
I...
...I'm positive this time...
Oh God...
I never asked you to quit!
Who?
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
It's alright.
She can't be here without me.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
You don't have to do that.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
What?
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
Who the hel1 -
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
You - are - a - murderer.
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Made it...?
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Yessss...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
My jury's still out on that,
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
And whose houses do you design...?
Why don't you let at do that...?
Stop it.
I can't.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
You can't just -
He's got great hands.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
The one on the left - definitely...
I heard something like that
I thought you were someone else
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
BRIAN...
Yes it is...
This must be one of the old keys -
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
I don't know...
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
What is it?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
First finish your tea...
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I want you out now
Is LESLIE here?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Dr STECKLER?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Check this out.  Hurry!
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I mean, what do you think?
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Just say it, Dad.
You do know how to drive?
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
James, what are you doing here?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You want it in writing?
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
But you never do.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
That's hard to believe.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
Very ambitious. I like that.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
I never figured you for a pimp.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
You look pretty.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Unless what?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
If you want company...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
The teeth, were they...
Yeah... okay... he did
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Okay, what's the matter?
Kelly.  What is it?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Hello.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
Duquette.  Forget him...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
I just want my life back...
Come on, let loose!
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Where is she?
You, Kelly, Sam.
And she wanted to talk.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Jesus, man... You okay?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Shit. Here we go again.
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
That's a lot of butler.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Know what this is?
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
I know!  I know!
He calls it the Tarantula.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Your private train, sir.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
They're coming.
Hey...!
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
They look like acorns.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
He's no magician.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Thanks for your help, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Are you a warrior?
What's that?  I hear something!
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Because she's sick.
You?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Dada, what's a daikini?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
Why?
Time is running out.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Hey, careful there!
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
I've seen pictures.
Hey, Sam...
Is it them?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Are they going to kill you?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Oh, he's good.
You know who?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
It's all over, Paul.
Where are you taking us?
What was that?
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Home.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Where's the nearest telephone?
Won him over just like that.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
Johnny, what the fuck?
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Did you find him?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
I don't know where he is.
That has no place in this house.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Ahh!  Ah!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Why --
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oh --
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh! Something bit me, too!
...yes.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
How about a hippopotamus?
Because I'm still scared!
I have so got brains.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
To Oz?
He said his mouth.
Here -- here --
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- Oh --
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Fine.  He's got a plan
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Oh - look out.
Well, I --
Who’s she?
Nuclear.
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Who is it?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Yes.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
I can’t stay here.
I can’t stay.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
God isn't there to do it.
Hi, Jon.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Because --
You're the only human being I care for.
Jon, where are we?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
His what?
His . . . whatever.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What the hell -- ?
They're following us.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Where's Laurie?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
He's a little farther gone every time.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Whatchu doing here?
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
You do everything Yorgi says?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
What...?
What's the deal?
What's so damn funny?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
That was for Anders.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
He takes his work seriously.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Who?
How?
Don't you knock?
What did she do to me?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
The way what is going to be?
It does indeed, Max.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Give him an extra dollar.
What in God's name are you doing?
MMMmmmm.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Love me oodles and oodles?
You have your tickets?
Yes, don't worry.
Darling!
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
It seems fine.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
A week.  Ten days at most.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Are you putting me on?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
There.
Wockers with the knockers???
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good?
You're sure you know what you're doing?
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What???
Come on, big fellow!
MMMmmmmmm.
Extremely well.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
